Beautiful film but so preachy Love of Legacy Margot does the best with what she s given but this film was very disappointing to me It was marketed as a fun quirky satire with homages to other movies It started that way but ended with over dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something but left everyone just feeling confused And before you say Im a crotchety old man Im a woman in my s so Im pretty sure Im this movies target audience The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing because this is not a kids movie Overall the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the strong woman out of this Was this in to,6.0,21 July 2023,0.9857
Clever and fun beginning turns into another lecture in the patriarchy B ink conn Barbie begins in an irresistible way as a fun dismantling of all the plastic i zed and body image ideals the doll has set for little girls throughout the decades as Barbie faces an existential crisis and must journey into the real world to find her true self Then about halfway through America shows up as a dissatisfied Barbie designer and starts hammering us about the patriarchy as if all men were clueless macho oafs like Ken that needed to be smugly tolerated by the greater hierarchy of women Ger wig seems to be projecting her issues about Hollywood and it makes Barbie out of touch out of this Was this in to,6.0,21 July 2023,0.891

A Technicolor Dream heather gers Wow this movie was a love letter to cinema From the Kubrick reference at the opening to the being real no cgi for the sets There were dance sequences like in the olden days think Grease and the costuming wow the costuming Greta Ger wig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way The casting director also nailed it everyone was wonderful The acting was perfection I loved seeing the variety of on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences this has to be a voluntary PG rating as there wasnt swearing or nudity There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that s not really violence compared to average films no one was harmed nor any fake blood used I actually didnt like the ending at all and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion something Ruth Handler never dealt with Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter that so tough to explain Irregardless I want to see this movie again And again And again out of this Was this in to,9.0,24 July 2023,0.9653

Barbie Is A Weirdly Fun Movie Habib ie Hakim While im not so sure at first the movie kept getting even more fun entertaining and definitely better also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept definitely the first time that s ever done Greta Ger wig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie from the intentionally weird yet creative editing some awkward and cringe scene i the comedy so funny instead of cringe Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie ive seen in a while we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are but Will Ferrell S imu Liu and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining the soundtrack was just great except Nicki and Ice Spice Barbie World song that are just absolutely terrible but Billie E il ish What Was I Made For tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional anyway Barbie is a lot of fun while there is still some noticeable flawed most of them i it funny entertaining colourful creative and fun pure fun its something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it but as of right now Barbie was a good time definitely recommended and with this movie somehow its actually possible to have a live action Barbie movie all you need to have is a good writer good director and good cast and they delivers mostly out of this Was this in to,8.0,19 July 2023,0.9987

High Highs Low Lows The first thing you need to know about Barbie is that Ryan Gosling is the best part of the entire film For the duration he is over the top dumb and hilarious Every scene he was in had me laughing and I enjoyed just about everything he did in the film Margot Robbie is a great choice for Barbie and as usual puts in a fantastic performance She hit pretty much every mark in my opinion and I cant see anyone taking her place in this role Where the film falls flat unfortunately is not the characters actors or even humour for that matter Its the incessant political lecturing Its no surprise that this film takes a strong feminist angle That s to expected Barbie was a doll that portrayed many different professions in an attempt to show young girls that they could strive for me than what they were told they could do But that was the s This is By no means is the world a perfect representation of equality today but it is so vastly superior in that category than it ever has been that the theme of the film falls a little flat Telling young girls to go after their dreams and not be beholden to any stereotypes is a positive wonderful message and one that been portrayed so much better But instead the film teeters on the edge of a radical feminist position Ive seen a lot of people say the film hates men I disagree with this I dont think it hates men Instead it takes a very simplistic black and white view of Western culture and assumes that womens lives are overall difficult and mens lives are overall quite easy When in reality life is tough For everyone At least of us Claiming otherwise is unjust However its not just the political stance it takes that brings the film down Its how incessant it is They are without any shame pushing a political message through the screen down your throat every minutes Its unbearable at times Going to the cinema or watching a film should be an enjoyable experience not a lecture This film been beloved by all genders and ages Both men and women love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling This feels like an easy lay up for the but by going the political route they end up having many jokes go over kids heads and alienate many of the people who where genuinely excited to see this film I give it a because of Gosling and most of the humour It was enjoyable overall I think Hollywood needs to stop employing multi millionaire actors to lecture the general public on how to live Its embarrassing out of this Was this in to,6.0,24 July 2023,0.9957

Barbie A Multifaceted Exploration of Femininity Consumerism and Existentialism andy paps I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go I did not tell a soul As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street c red Anyway I embraced the journey and Im glad that I did Here is my written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life In Greta Ger wigs latest directorial venture Barbie the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken Ger wigs live action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon Ger wig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure comedy fantasy and romance The result is a thought provoking exploration of role as a feminist symbol challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals Ger wig compels the audience to contemplate this question weaving it throughout the fabric of the film In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon The fl m was fun and far above my expectations hence Im giving it an and boasting I watched Barbie out of this Was this in to,8.0,19 July 2023,0.992
It could have been so much better hamster i nation The universe and settings are fantastic The casting is really good too with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken Regrettably however the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie Instead were left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film Instead of seeing a light fun film I saw a rather heavy handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy Its a real shame because the potential is pretty amazing I came away disappointed but not totally disgusted either out of this Was this in to,6.0,19 July 2023,0.9064

Creative but preachy and confusing Im short ok Im just going to get straight to the point I liked some aspects of this movie and disliked other parts Cinematography awesome Choreographed musical numbers hilarious Comedy good Margot Robbie great Ryan Gosling awesome and arguably the best part of the movie The scenery and props really did help create the world The storyline started off very intriguing However when the movie got to the meat of the plot and the central conflict its message became confusing Its like they wanted to make Ken the bad guy yet also sympathetic which is not impossible or unheard of but the way the writers did this was ineffective Also the resolution didnt make sense based on the message and events that led up to it Lastly I really hate it when movies try to empower women by dumb ing down the men I get that in a Barbie world Ken is an afterthought but in the real world all men were also dumb They also treated masculine qualities as evil I hate stereotyping people men included and its like all men ride horses and have fragile egos and drink brew skies And for goodness sake if I had a dollar for every time the movie said patriarchy Id be rich So overall I give this movie a out of this Was this in to,6.0,23 July 2023,0.9796
I am K enough eoin a geary So I went into the movie with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly impressed with the movie overall So basically the movie is about Barbie who is starting to feel emotions and not everything feels perfect in Barbie land She ventures to the real world to discover the solution of getting everything perfect again Barbie is joined by the one and not only KEN Ken is obsessed with Barbie and sees her as the centre of his world he goes to the real world and discovers patriarchy which leads to many events The movie overall is actually quite funny Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken and the stand out for me he needs to be many versions of Ken and he kills then all Margot t is also great she brings a range to Barbie for me also Weird Barbie was great she was funny and brought a difference There were times I felt the woman power thing was just a bit much and took me out of the movie I feel like the movie had that message and didnt need to shove it down your throat but it decided to at points so for me that does bring it down a notch the daughter was also just annoying hah aha yes I get it she hated the world bla bla she just had no redeeming qualities otherwise no complains and I do think its worth seeing solid out of this Was this in to,8.0,23 July 2023,-0.4644

No Direction ander mic The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre However the messages of the movie were the problem I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women cant be anything It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a year old I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible That s just whatever because what really matters is the story Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing The pacing was horrible the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run the story was all over the place and it is totally not for kids I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasnt points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect to be an appropriate rating out of this Was this in to,6.0,21 July 2023,-0.857
Strong Start and That s It loki cola I walked out of the theatre thinking Yeah I had a good time in that movie But as the day went on I kind had that Ok that kebab probably wasnt a good idea The film is stunning in its production design and creativity and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie For the most part the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments Barbie realising she s not as perfect as she s been made to believe or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he s ever had in his life They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film I dont know why but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality The Barbie brand history controversies are so en grained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world and what the future could be That s a lot of pressure for one film I know However this film is absolutely not immune to the not so subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently In fact it embraces is So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside in broad daylight in a crowded space in front of her boyfriend And this kind of portrayal of men in appears to be how the film views the world Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it but upon reflection I realise now its just kind of yuck Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world but offer and foster some ideas for change Instead we receive divisive and mean spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life And also flat feet and If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit and dont take this film too seriously then maybe you ll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie But if you need to do that to enjoy something then you need to ask yourself why out of this Was this in to,6.0,24 July 2023,0.9978

Were All Dolls k last a it as Without consumerism without belief without plastic accessory and hope for a perfect day where would Barbie find herself And more importantly where would we find ourselves In a plot that seems stitched together like an old pair of vintage jeans that you just cant let go of Greta Ger wig serves us a platter of modern satire and deep analysis of the condition that we find ourselves in today Barbie is perfect Until she s not And she s becomes accustomed to our culture The perspective of an otherwise perfect doll born from a matriarchy is wholly interesting and captivating as we laugh hate and cry throughout the movie Barbie must find out what is wrong with her owner but in doing so she discovers imperfect humanity and falls in love with it This is the story and it is told brilliantly There is no need to mention the phenomenal performances by each and every actor in this film The set design the costumes the cinematography are all a testament to Greta Ger wigs skill as a director To view this film as merely a feminist blockbuster is to ignore the fact that feminism is not just womans problem but a humanity s problem This is what the movie displays Go into it with an open mind and you will see that it does not preach for women to rule men but for men and women to discover themselves without being pressured by the culture around them A message which needs to be broadcast across the world in a time of such needless division We are all forced to live like dolls in this world and we must escape from this and discover ourselves It is amazing to see Greta Ger wig and Noah Baum bach tackle such daring themes and pull it off The comedy throughout provided by celebrity cameos and hilarious satire is spot on The soundtrack is astounding and in particular Billie E il song What was I made for is a fantastic close to the journey of discovery that Barbie and Ken have been through A brilliant achievement in modern film making that makes me hopeful for the future as we tackle more and more complex issues head on rather than watch boring old men debate uselessness on out of this Was this in to,8.0,28 July 2023,0.995
Fun film whose script falls in on itself mark Margot performance is perfect and no other actor embodied the character as well as she does However Ryan Gosling is the film stealer I often forget his comedic talent and he s given a lot of room to flex it in this A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls it does attempt to carry a moral message However the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat The movie starts off well being smartly self aware and offering a tongue in cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience However as it progresses the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy handed especially in the dialogue heavy third act which weighs down the overall narrative The set and wardrobe designs are a standout I think kids will love this part alone even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads Overall its a fun film but not without its flaws Its likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary If you re looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids and you re willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply then its an enjoyable watch out of this Was this in to,6.0,19 July 2023,0.9833

A lot like the Lego Movie and there s a lot to like Vic max As a guy who never played with Barbie dolls I was surprised to be caught up in the enthusiasm to see this movie I purchased tickets well in advance when they first went on sale Its amazing to think that a few years back Amy Schumer was going to star in the title role Though after seeing Margot Robbie its hard to imagine anyone else in that spot Anyway like most movie goers I enjoyed this movie Its a lot like The Lego Movie with its high energy colorful world building meta jokes self aware characters and variety of insider fan humor The A Space Odyssey beginning clearly aimed at adult viewers was priceless However unlike The Lego Movie I can definitely say that the first half was enormously more entertaining compared to the second The first half was energized by all the Barbie accessories character introductions high energy music and a very cool plot reveal involving the real world But unlike The Lego Movie the second half while not bad wasnt able to keep the momentum going While there was a lot of action and drama it felt more hit and miss The message was good you dont have to be perfect to be happy just be true to yourself However its delivery felt a bit too complex for kids and maybe even for some adults The empowering commentary about womanhood was eloquent but it seemed like the writers had trouble getting from that point to a strong and uplifting ending It almost felt a bit melancholy for whatever reason But don t let that stop you from enjoying this movie There s a lot to like and its kind of a cultural moment and opportunity to connect with all the Barbie love that spans generations Enjoy this experience with a big audience and you ll be glad you did out of this Was this in to,7.0,29 July 2023,0.9968

Expected more from Greta Ger wig JP ARM Even though Im not the target audience for this movie I thought Barbie might impress me due to Greta Ger wigs previous works but Im disappointed The main problem is that the overall message isnt clear This doesnt go to say that the movie is frivolous What happens is that it gets lost trying to get around multiple meaningful topics and never reaches the It addresses relevant themes like patriarchy sexism gender roles exist en m imperfection individuality and identity but always on a shallow level Every scene in this script tries to convince you that its saying something profound when in reality it sacrifices depth and character development in favor of cheap humor which results in an immature and non compelling production In contrast Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were perfectly casted and their performances are as good as the screenplay allows them to be The production and costume design from Barbie Land are noteworthy too Hopefully Greta Ger wig will release other movies in the future as brilliant as Lady Bird which I genuinely think deserves stars out of this Was this in to,6.0,26 July 2023,0.9769

Surprisingly good Jeremy Ur qu hart I think part of my brain rejects this for being a feature length toy commercial but its a very small part of my brain and that really wasnt where my mind was for the majority of the movie Overall its probably about as good as an official live action Barbie movie could ever be with Greta Ger wig clearly given plenty of freedom to have fun with a property movie like this Its bigger in scale than her previous two films Ladybird and Little Women both of which I prefer to this by a little and the scale and creativity of the film really kept the momentum going Its very funny in parts and though I guess its sort of a kid friendly movie there are tons of jokes and references that ll go over the heads of younger kids What s a fascist is something I heard a four year old ask one of their parents halfway through the movie and that in itself was kind of funny to hear Margot Robbie is good as always and is given a surprising amount to do emotionally It is movie but Ryan Ken often steals the film whenever he s on screen as the wrapping up there s a fairly awkward pivot to oh yeah this is movie its even addressed in dialogue I dont think that s a problem because he s hilarious it might be one of the best performances he s ever given I also dont think his character is used just to attack men the way I imagine some people will read into it Barbie does the most learning and has the biggest character arc sure but Ken goes through one too and I thought they wrapped up that side of things nicely Its an enjoyable movie that deals with some hefty topics name dropping plenty of words younger kids wont have even heard before in a mostly consistent way Some tonal shifts are jarring and while the vast majority of jokes land I dont think all did It does also feel a bit too directly like a commercial at a couple of points especially early on but I did expect that And its a testament to the quality of the movie that me and all my anti consumer is t thoughts didnt overpower my mind throughout most of this out of this Was this in to,8.0,23 July 2023,0.996
It was good but far too preachy terry form a I really enjoyed the movie The acting was amazing Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was amazing I just thought it was too on the nose Like the message was literally forced in your face It seemed lazy to me I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had ve taken some elements from it because it made it much more powerful if so Im not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up Overall for me its a Good film but that s all Definitely been less preachy Ultimately its nice movie to see and Id see it again at some point but it wasnt great out of this Was this in to,6.0,24 July 2023,0.9777
Positively surprised R ali fax Addresses current critical issues basically the movie revolves around that The central ideas are patriarchy and female empowerment which I believe were handled intelligently and elegantly I was particularly surprised in this regard I didnt expect the film to be so mature I also want to highlight the makeup set photography and choreography Top notch flawless The context is also interesting the script is creative and the story is engaging making the film much more fluid Personally that s what I liked the most how the fantasy and the reality interact The actors were amazing too and not only the main characters Some other human characters were underdeveloped compared to Barbie and Ken but that was expected As a man I recon that this is a movie that speaks to women but also to men sensible to women struggles I went to watch it without expecting more than a visually beautiful film and I left the cinema positively surprised out of this Was this in to,8.0,19 July 2023,0.9808

This movie tries to be too much brian johnson I wanted to like it But I just didnt The story wasnt very compelling to me because it seemed as if the entire point of much of the movie was to provide learning moments for viewers with some slapstick comedy and quick delivery comedy The story itself should nearly always be more important All of the go of in ess largely would have been excused to me if the comedic moments were really funny And the way this film was hyped made me think it was going to be super funny But I rarely laughed And that s even more of a shame given the talent assembled for the cast There also were nt many surprising reveals to the audience when maybe there could have been if things were presented differently I also it annoying to see Will Farrell play a similar part to what he played in the Lego Movie Sure he s a CEO rather than a dad But he was filling the same evil disciplinarian adult role for a movie about a kids toy It just felt lazy to not cast someone else for that part and just made me wish the movie was able to provide the humor and intrigue that the first Lego movie provided to its audience Id rather this film felt like a comedy or dramatic experience which has some relevant takes on feminism and culture than thinly veiled sermon with occasional jokes that land amongst a ton that didnt land I also felt like the movie had way too many characters and ideas thrown together There was Barbie Ken many other many other Kens the crazy Barbie the the mother the teen the narrator and more And its not just that they had all of these characters They also tried to have some learning moments delivered by or delivered to a majority of these characters I felt like they would have been better off trying to deliver all these lessons over movies rather than And obviously you dont want it ever to seem like the lessons are being delivered but experiences through the story and the consequences of the actions and stakes created by the characters decisions Instead there didnt seem like any stakes because the didnt seem to fit in the real world and the real people didnt fit in the Barbie world Honestly my favorite part of the movie was a lot of the Easter egg stuff about odd Barbie products over the years And Easter eggs shouldnt be the best part of any movie They should be a bonus to the overall experience of the story out of this Was this in to,4.0,24 July 2023,0.9942
More Than Meets The Eye bank of marquis The Margot Robbie Ryan Gosling curiosity BARBIE is a subversive film This Greta Ger wig directed move lures you in by presenting a farcical satirical look at the pastel colored Barbie land and the myriad of outfits and golly gosh goodness of the world of this iconic doll and her boyfriend Ken Once you are comfortably settled into this world you are transformed to the real world and the much deeper themes of a womens place in a patriarchal world As another slogan puts it there s more than meets the eye to this film And one should have expected something more than just a surface y fun film from the Writer Director of such fare as LADYBIRD and FRANCES HA Ger wing uses the stereotypes of Barbie and Ken to take a look at our society and the inherent hierarchy of the sexes while peeling back the layers of the key players to make them more than the plastic dolls they portray And it works surprisingly well for adults not so much for kids Margot Robbie of course is perfectly cast as the titular Barbie She has the looks and the vacuous devil may care attitude of Stereotype Barbie and is a comfortable pleasing entity to share this adventure with But with Ger wigs direction performance reveals subtly layer after layer until at the end we end up with a full fledged character and not just a living doll Ryan Gosling is just as strong as counterpart Ken He morphs from a Barbie worshipping boyfriend to something else once he encounters the real male dominated world The Bank of Marquis wondered why Gosling would agree to do a film that on its surface appears to be a one note joke fest but once the film really drives to its point one can see why Gosling agreed to be in this Is s a Rae Kate McKinnon S imu Liu Michael ra Helen as the narrator and America Ferrara all spark at times during this film while it was good to see Rhea Perlman Carla on CHEERS have a role that she could sink her teeth into Only Will Ferrell as the money hungry CEO of falls short of interesting His character one of the only real world characters in this film stays stereotypical throughout the movie He is the only complete caricature in this film and perhaps that is on purpose Credit for the surprising depth of this film goes to Ger wig who brings her sensibilities to this film to make a comment on our society Its a bold move by Ger wig and works well unless you are a Mom that is bringing your or year old child to this film And that is the caution to this movie Its not necessarily made for the youngsters that play with The kids will love the early going of this film but the more adult themes in the middle of the movie will probably make a good deal of them squirm in their seats since these moments of depth will go over their heads A surprisingly fun and deeper than it appears to be film this Barbie is a multi level dream house Letter Grade A stars out of and you can take that to the Bank of Marquis out of this Was this in to,8.0,21 July 2023,0.9976
Barbie has an existential crisis No Life Barbie is a really fun movie that all ages can enjoy because while its colourful and entertaining the main storyline can get emotional at times The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll like the food and drink were plastic and fake the cars didnt have engines and just glided along the floor and the actors were doll like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment The sheer amount of details that are in this movie is amazing from the clothes the wide variety of dolls cars pets houses and even down to the accessories were a perfect match to what s being sold or what has been sold in the past On another note I was not expecting the plot twist and the antagonist to be revealed but that s what I liked about this movie I went in thinking to know what this movie was going to be about but I was wrong and was surprised As the movie progresses you find yourself enjoying it more and more its well paced and it has a good story so I definitely recommend it out of this Was this in to,8.0,22 July 2023,0.9882

A Hot Pink Mess a herd of beautiful wild ponies Before making Barbie Greta Ger wig single handedly directed two films Lady Bird and Little Women Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother daughter relationships both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue Both were very very good Given those credentials one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent convincing and amusing a picture and well it isnt The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land a place where Barbie played by Margot Robbie is having the best day every day in the company of other and occasionally Kens The designs costumes and cinematography do an excellent job re creating the vision in its pink plastic perfection The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film it is smartly self aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything a President a Physicist a Journalist a Lawyer or a Mermaid Much like with the original toys Ken comes as an afterthought and only exists within the warmth of gaze The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet she feels her heels hit the ground What follows is journey in reverse the parallel is explicit and ultimately a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit as promised by the trailer it could be an interesting exploration in the way of or Instead the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts threats and plot lines that are never fully realised What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box Why is Gloria the receptionist at the headquarters and later Real World companion depressed and how is that eventually resolved Why is daughter Sasha cross with her mother Why does the board of spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes Most importantly the crux of the third act conflict set in Barbie Land now renamed Kendo m contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants Towards the finale the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles One side is presented as clueless and attention seeking while the other is manipulative and vengeful The film repeatedly takes offence with mans plain ing yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience rather than on storytelling While the denouement includes one of the highlights the musical number Im Just Ken the ending does not resolve or acknowledge much and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive Barbie is very easy on the eye and the acting ranges from competent to inspired with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors Margot Robbie is pitch perfect as Barbie and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart often stealing the show Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land while some of the bon mot s are funny yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters If only this were better written If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth out of this Was this in to,6.0,26 July 2023,0.9845

Exceeds Expectations a say ed If you told me a few years ago that one of the best movies in and arguably the highest grossing one is going to be Barbie I would have laughed and called you crazy But here we are and the atmosphere in the theatre felt like a cultural revolution which can become You just had to be there moment for the Gen Z s Through the medium of this film Greta Ger wig expresses the frustrations of all women and at the same time presents a satirical take on patriarchy The movie praises Barbie for being a feminist icon but at the same acknowledges its regressive ness Ken is basically every man who embodies patriarchal ideals just for being rejected as he feels accepted in the real world but gets ignored in the Barbie land which was a stark reflection on how women feel in the real world At the end it has a beautiful message for all women The script is genuinely funny with bucket load of hilarious moments and lines Ryan Gosling brings his A game as Ken saying that his expressions are hilarious would be an understatement Ryan has basically understood the assignment Margot Robbie was basically born to play the role of Barbie as she fits into the role to a T You can feel her as she is going through an existential crisis The set design and costumes were praiseworthy and clearly deserves an Oscar nod The costumes of each and Kens have been designed so beautifully and intricately that it bears a mention The buildings in Barbie land have also been created with love and passion for the universe The architecture of the movie is a visual treat for the audience The cinematography of the film does a good job of presenting the Barbie with glitz and glitter It is pink and completely un apologetic about it The soundtrack is an icing on the cake I am just Ken is still stuck on my mind as I am penning down this However I do feel that the supporting cast was wasted as th sy had very little to do In conclusion the movie is a popcorn munch er but at the same time delivers a heartfelt message which is very important for the world out of this Was this in to,9.0,23 July 2023,0.9957

Hardly any laughter in my theater though perhaps the film wasnt meant to entertain Sure Comma Not In one sense this film was more inevitable than Than os What do you get when you re part of a society that fuels existential crises by constantly eroding definitions and structures Barbie and Ken arent exactly human they dont even have genitals they re embodied ideas and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presupposition al views of a happy society against that of the real world But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking its a dragon So how much can an audience glean from the fi cations of characters who are essentially children I would have greatly preferred more well versed in sociology as well as comedy writers who understand not only American ideals and how those ideals have shifted but the role that Barbie has played along the way I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact without really understanding much beyond that There was so much to explore and it could have been shown situation ally rather than through heavy handed exposition Off screen apparently Ken had some interesting realization s about his misunderstandings of patriarchy and Barbie had some realization s about how she treated Ken but we dont get to see any of this nuance actually played out Hugely missed opportunities there Bottom line As fantastic as Robbie and Gosling were I wish this movie just didnt exist Keep the cast but try again with a much better script and director out of this Was this in to,3.0,25 July 2023,0.9883
There is an art house movie under all that pink b jacob I tend to gravitate towards French cinema and the classics the idea of watching a franchise movie about Barbie seemed mildly repellent at first Well I am glad I kept an open mind This is a riotous ly funny zany meta comedy with touches of Wes Anderson and yet also strangely affecting The idea of giving a plastic doll an existential crisis may seem gimmicky yet it works The cracks showing in the perfect fa a de of the perfect Barbie world are rendered through metaphors that hit the mark full of a strange melancholia I am usually put off by sentimentalism s here thankfully they are kept at a bare minimum even in the ending Overall I am astonished this film exists at all I imagine the authors meeting with a slightly distracted executive being given a of dollars with the vaguest of briefs and running away with it to make a film that would send any corporate committee into a tailspin I imagine a first projection with the producers fainting and having a heart attack yet also make them laugh all the way to the bank However it happened chap eau I am glad I went Ill buy the as well I can see myself re watching it to be sure I got all the micro gags and layers of meaning but also putting it on when I need a little pick me up out of this Was this in to,9.0,21 July 2023,0.9071
A darkly satirical look at gender structure in society Mr DH Wong Barbie is a comedy film based on the line of fashion dolls by Directed and co written by Greta Ger wig Lady Bird Little Women and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling it takes every opportunity to revel in its amusing premise with a darkly satirical look at gender structure in society In Barbie land a matriarchal utopia where all women are successful Stereotypical Barbie Margot Robbie lives a happy life spending time with her female friends and hanging out with her boyfriend Stereotypical Ken Ryan Gosling One night at a dance party Stereotypical Barbie suddenly finds herself contemplating her own mortality and worries about what her future holds The next day Stereotypical Barbie discovers she is now unable to follow her usual routine which results in her perfect skin breaking out in blemishes After following advice from Weird Barbie Kate McKinnon Stereotypical Barbie travels in her convertible to the real world to meet the child who plays with her unaware that Stereotypical Ken has stowed away onboard If you had to name a more iconic doll associated with little girls Im sure nearly everyones first pick would be none other than Barbie Since first being launched back in Barbie has taken the world by storm with the doll filling many different roles including but not limited to a doctor lawyer astronaut and even President of the United States There have also been many movies made that star Barbie in leading roles all of which have been CGI animated and released exclusively to video and streaming sites Now adding to that catalogue Greta Ger wigs live action cinematic feature titled simply Barbie is not only a fantastic send up of gender roles but also a great comedy film in its own right that virtually everyone can enjoy regardless of age gender or political leaning What could have been another generic film for parents to put on in the background to keep their young daughters quiet is actually one of the cleverest of the worlds view of the societal hierarchy since The LEGO Movie When we first see Barbie land it is shown to be a bustling exuberant paradise that is perfect for all of its inhabitants That is of course only if you are a woman and not one of the Kens where their enjoyment is based solely on being an accessory to the other It is obvious that this is a place where men cannot make a name for themselves which sets in motion Stereotypical desire to travel with Stereotypical Barbie into the real world Upon arriving Ken learns that this new place is the mirror opposite of Barbie land with real life society valuing patriarchy over matriarchy In any normal instance I would have rolled my eyes watching a movie allude to contentious political matters like this but I quickly realised that the film is actually attacking both sides of the spectrum in the best way possible In Barbie land the matriarchy causes the women to exude toxic femininity towards men while in the real world we see the patriarchy make men show off their toxic masculinity towards women Neither of these are glorified and where this film succeeds greatly is in the way it cleverly in forms the audience that the extremes on both ends are what causes problems with society and that too much of either always leads to bad results In addition to s at i rising gender norms the film also functions as an amusing gag packed comedy for casual viewers as well There were a number of moments where I myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes being made about the autonomous way Barbie populace live their lives For instance the are incapable of touching the ground with flat feet due to their default designs being made for high heel shoes Also the Kens are almost always seen at the beach awaiting instructions from the other only for most of them to be ignored However some of the most hilarious parts occur when Barbie and Ken are in the real world allowing for some humorous fish out of water scenes involving their interactions with real people There s even the occasional jab taken at themselves parodying the commercialism surrounding Barbie and all her accessories While not every single joke lands there are so many of them that for every one that fails there are plenty of others that work just fine In fact without giving it away this film has one of the funniest closing lines to a movie Ive ever heard so much so that it actually caught me off guard during my initial viewing I also liked the practical production design of this movie with minimal CG giving Barbie land a real toy like aesthetic As one might expect the most prominently used colour here is pink Nearly everything important in this world is pink pink houses pink beds pink lamp posts etc Believe it or not there was actually a worldwide shortage of pink paint due to the amount that was used to make this place look as authentically girly as possible Later when Barbie and Ken are exploring the outside world things look decidedly ordinary but since they are still wearing their brightly coloured outfits the two to stick out like a sore thumb from everybody else Its rare for a film to effectively use its colour palette to evoke comedy so effectively and this one handles it in a way that all ages will understand it As a Barbie girl living in her Barbie world Margot Robbie is clearly having a great time portraying this stereotypical version of the iconic doll The fact that there s nothing especially noteworthy about this specific Barbie means that she has the most room to grow as a character Barbie is friendly fun loving but blissfully ignorant of what her boyfriend Ken truly wants with her Though not outright malicious she inadvertently makes Ken feel unwanted due to her conditioned attitude towards all the other Kens in her world What I liked best about performance was the way she shows an open mindedness to the character She is curious about what type of world lies beyond Barbie land and whether things will be the same or different to what she is used to It would have been easy to have made this Barbie a man hating blonde bimbo with no capacity for independent thought but rather she remains pleasant towards everyone and is willing to learn about new experiences on her journey Whether intentional or not I think Ryan version of Ken steals the movie practically every time he is shown on screen Maybe its because Im so used to seeing Gosling play stoic subdued roles but watching him come to life as this version of boyfriend was quite a surprise Although this isnt the first comedic role Gosling has played it is here that he effectively demonstrates all the humorous possibilities he is capable of as an actor We watch Ken try to surf at the beach as a means to impress Barbie only to realise he cannot swim in the place mat water Later he tries to apply for certain jobs in the real world based solely on his gender but is told that he needs proper qualifications in order to be taken seriously by employers There s just something about the way Gosling is able to showcase such loveable pathos as Ken that makes you want to see how he can become more than just the generic partner of his more famous girlfriend From the perspective of a something heterosexual man who has never once expressed interest in playing with dolls the film Barbie pulls off the miraculous task of transcending above its stereotypical audience of young girls to appeal to all viewers instead It offers an observant satire about the worlds views on gender roles while also functioning as an amusing comedy film packed with jokes galore No matter what your general opinion on Barbie may be whether you love her as an entertaining toy or hate her because you dont care for what she represents

Great acting but why this movie mori ume molt re I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing The movie works There is definitely a moral message in this even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great Over all its a fun family movie to enjoy together I watched this and afterwards Oppenheimer last night and I am truly glad I did it in that order because I doubt that I would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if I had watched Oppenheimer first out of this Was this in to,6.0,20 July 2023,0.9962
Drop the kids at Oppenheimer the adults can see a real philosophical masterpiece New gen W Im not someone who often watches comedies so they dont make me laugh much but if they all became as funny as Barbie I might give it another go Because I really laughed out loud during the film It did away perfectly with the comedy and the moralizing a bit deeper philosophical stuff Of course the soundtrack is top notch the sets are breathtaking and there s Ryan Gosling the main reason I came In addition to all that this film is a good critic of patriarchal rule without overdoing it It questions gender roles in a fluid way and brings existential questions to the fore By the way I dont understand the opinions of those who didnt like the film because it promoted feminism Whereas Barbie is literally an invention designed to make women feel as important as men in society to break down stereotypes and glorify gender equality Ok whatever go and see it its worth it out of this Was this in to,8.0,19 July 2023,0.9912
Over hyped movie had its moments though hy ll us The first half was pretty enjoyable fun light but it took itself too seriously by the second half No longer allowing the talented cast especially Gosling to shine and make us laugh It felt like the talents of Will Ferrell and Michael Cera were also somewhat under utilized Interesting concept had potential but later in the movie it definitely started to fall flat for me Ryan Gosling definitely held this movie together for me without the laughs he gave me it definitely been lower than I think there was just too much of a push to bring politics into the movie Some is fine but it enveloped the movie entirely by the end Whether or not any of the political stuff was accurate it felt forced and out of place out of this Was this in to,6.0,23 July 2023,0.9742
Ill beach you off so hard Feast Mode I had no idea what to expect going into Barbie I had no interest in seeing a movie about Barbie but was immediately sold on the highly talented Margot Robbie and the awesome Ryan Gosling But I was still nervous that the comedy would be aimed strictly at women and would be difficult for a guy to enjoy To my surprise I didnt feel that at all This movie is hilarious Its the kind of stupid funny I love the kind usually reserved for dude movies Something you re more likely to see in a Will Ferrell movie I was not aware Ryan Gosling could be so funny Even though the majority of the movie is silly and fun Margot Robbie still gives a great performance as usual She continues to prove she s a star And most of the supporting cast are welcomed additions I Barbie highly entertaining I think most will enjoy it except maybe guys who are sensitive to anything empowering women or making fun of men That s not me The parts that made me laugh the most are the jokes about the guys viewing early fan screening Ultra Screen out of this Was this in to,7.0,20 July 2023,0.9971

Wildly misunderstood by the poor reviewers annie ble as dale Unfortunately most reviews that Ive read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film It is not anti men it does not portray men as stupid Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century oh yes just as Ken is here The movie exaggerates this yes That is the point To clearly and ly highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed Stop being offended by something that isnt offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched The film was fun emotional moving sad and empowering in many ways I must admit I had nt expected to enjoy this film but wow what a surprise out of this Was this in to,9.0,23 July 2023,0.9339

Refreshing and Creative More Than Just a Gimmick Dan W Reviews Barbie is a delightful and creatively refreshing comedy that breathes new life into the iconic dolls world From the moment the film began I was captivated by its smart and subversive storytelling which cleverly blends meta humour with a dash of eccentricity The production design is a standout feature a visually dazzling and wonderfully pink themed universe Margot portrayal of Barbie is nothing short of impressive skilfully capturing both the characters earnestness and humour Her performance combined with Greta Ger wigs skilful directing makes for a truly entertaining and memorable experience Throughout the film I myself chuckling at the witty humour and enjoying the unexpectedly bold take on what Barbie represents The movie strikes a fine balance between honouring the iconic brand and playfully challenging its conventions resulting in a unique and rewarding cinematic experience While the intentions are commendable there were moments when it felt like the themes could have been explored more deeply leaving me slightly wanting more Nonetheless Barbie remains a fun and enjoyable ride filled with charm and charismatic performances that made it stand out as one of the years best comedies so far In the end Barbie proves to be much more than just a marketing gimmick showcasing a refreshing take on a beloved cultural icon and making it a must see for anyone seeking a smart humorous and visually arresting cinematic adventure out of this Was this in to,8.0,21 July 2023,0.9975
ABUSE OF THE BARBIE silva r studio Here s the thing In my eyes BARBIE happens at the beginning of the movie Amazingly created world with great looks and surprises now and then Lovely But then it feels like all about BARBIE is forgotten within seconds except for the pink color of course The movie turns into a quite weird direction with happenings that are very sought and often dont make any sense at all Suddenly everyone can jump around between two worlds and no one thinks that s crazy actually Suddenly the difference between Kens and Human beings is gone away ALTHOUGH in the beginning it shows definite differences like feet or fingers that arent separate Later on Ken plays the guitar and can move every single finger for example All in all the great love for detail from the beginning is gone quite fast and turns into a long childish and boring battle between manly men and aly females It starts to look like the TV show Love Island A loud unnecessary back and forth between genders At the end a try of a deep scene to let go a few deep words and that s it The movie teaches nothing to take home with Its more like the name BARBIE was abused for this one in my eyes out of this Was this in to,6.0,25 July 2023,0.9527

You ll appreciate this life in plastic film more than you can ever imagine i a man Only Greta Ger wig can pull this movie off She is the only one that can helm this movie right No other directors can do what she did for this movie Why Because the others would end up making this movie as generic or as plain as possible aka just another commercial blockbuster movie Greta Ger wig was able to turn the wheels from the overly used direction venturing into new territories most directors are afraid to go Barbie the Movie sends out strong messages and contexts about a lot of different things Some of them include patriarchy male dominated world female dominated world perfectionism teenage phase life adult ing gender equality equity sexual object if i cations amongst many others Now you must be shocked to hear all of this are conveyed in this film A Barbie film that talks about all this stuff YES This is X Factor having to bring these sensitive subjects into a movie for everyone catered for all audiences And children will still be entertained and understood with the story and the messages that Barbie brings to the table Verdict Filled with contexts and messages as rich as Oscar nominated films Barbie the Movie is a whole different game as it is full with surprises and hard hitting truths about the world we live in today It is self aware of what it is and Greta Ger wig daringly takes charge of crafting a masterpiece storytelling that capitalizes on the heavy subjects without downgrading anything or anyone maintaining both its quality and substance the entire film You ll appreciate this life in plastic film more than you can ever imagine out of this Was this in to,8.0,20 July 2023,0.9852
Well played PK For me Barbie came very very close to an rating The only reason it didnt quite get there was that it contains a few scenes that are too long and a bit too weak On the plus side there are several more things to mention First and foremost Barbie has attracted a very strong cast with well respected names also in several supporting roles and they all perform well Margot Robbie was almost an obvious casting choice With her skills and her appearance she really IS Barbie with a brain for almost two hours Director Greta Ger wig and her crew created perfect Barbie land sets which made me smile in spite of the fact that I never owned a Barbie doll myself The film had me laughing many times and it also brought me to tears a few times Quite impressive for a movie about a doll I thought And last but not least the message of the movie Already when I heard that Greta Ger wig was going to make a Barbie movie I knew we were in for a culture clash The fact that she went all in was not surprising to me but that she managed to convince to go along with her was Kudos not only to Greta Ger wig for that but also to This may turn out to prove enormously profitable for them in the end and they undoubtedly hope to make Barbie relevant for a few more generations Nevertheless this took guts on their part Well played out of this Was this in to,7.0,19 July 2023,0.9856
Didnt meet my expectation sole l mao I wanted to love this movie but it just wasnt it It was nothing that has nt been done before It didnt really say anything I hate using the word woke but hearing the same talking points is tiring We understand the patriarchy is bad But I didnt go to this movie to be preached to I was hoping it would be a bit more camp I was expecting it to be like the Barbie animated films you get which ng l are usually good This was far from that The ending was also a bit dragged out It was trying very hard to be profound and it wasnt working I didnt care for any of the characters much either and was a little sad to not see Raquel le or any of sisters apart from Skipper Apart from the criticism I thought the costume design was really well executed Margot Robbie looked fabulous at all times out of this Was this in to,4.0,21 July 2023,0.4217
La Vie en Rose sca Im not one of those people who feel the need to apologize for watching Barbie In my opinion there are no bad movie genres there are only good movies and bad movies And the cinema is also popular entertainment and buying a big bowl of popcorn and sitting in the air conditioned theater to watch a musical comedy that features some of the most talented actors of the moment cant be the worst thing on a hot summer day Barbie Greta Ger wigs film did not make me regret the decision to watch it for at least three quarters of its duration Barbie lives in an ideal world called Barbie land Actually I should use the plural but I dont really know how because its not just about the blonde doll we all know but about all the incarnations she has received over the decades blondes and brunettes with white yellow black or other skin colors thinner or bigger The multiple have the most diverse professions from doctor to Nobel laureate writer from astronaut to president of the United States Ultimately the Barbie universe was imagined to give courage and self confidence to little girls and in still in them the idea that anything is possible There are also boys they are generally called Ken but their purpose is to be the asexual partners when those are willing to pay attention to them The introduction to the film is excellent with a quote from A Space Odyssey and s narrated by Helen When stereotypical blonde Barbie starts getting into trouble the source is in the real world Barbie must face reality and the conflict between universes is inevitable The real world is not like the ideal world and the mixture of them will cause a revolution in Barbie land that will not necessarily be in the right direction The awakening to reality or if you will the humanization of Barbie comes at a price Barbie the movie works well most of the time especially when the focus is on the comedic and musical side and the message is integrated into the entertainment The production is excellent The sets the costumes the cinematography will surely receive Academy Awards nominations and in some categories Barbie may be the winner The soundtrack reminds at some points fragments from the history of the pop and ballad genres of the s and s Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are excellent in the lead roles and I wouldnt be surprised if Barbie dolls borrow their faces if they have nt already The messages are well punched and come across the screen quite well genuine and fake feminism and the way Barbie products reflect society s conception of the place role and appearance of women the more or less camouflaged misogyny of contemporary society corporations with their seemingly socially aligned messages camouflaging capitalist greed All of this is well dosed and combined with what happens on screen until the final part of the film when either the writers took themselves a little too seriously or they did not have enough inspiration and instead of continuing to infuse the dissolved messages into entertainment they resorted to rhetoric and created an ending that I forced and didactic Barbie was worth seeing for the fun part for the colours music and humour When playing with dolls it is good not to be overly serious out of this Was this in to,8.0,22 July 2023,0.9968

A Flamboyantly Doll light ful Adventure Mister roe n My mother was the only person I could convince to go watch Greta Ger wigs Barbie with me and wow am I glad we went Its been a while since Ive seen such a genuinely fun and creative movie Originality is what the world has been longing for The story is clever and manages to be remain lightheaded and witty while also conveying influential messages for and challenging the audience with questions about modern feminism and discovering who you really want to be no matter who you are This film is colorful and alive making it a joy to view upon The set pieces especially in Barbie land are brilliant and it truly makes me want to know if they actually built out a real life Barbie land set Did they The acting was brilliant from everyone you could tell they were all having a lot of enjoyment on set Margot Robbie carried this film for sure as one can come to expect from this modern superstar It was also enlightening to see Ryan Gosling take on such a comical role while also bringing a lot of depth to the character He has a great sense of comedic timing and humor From what Ive seen in interviews Ryan is basically embracing his comedic genius and I love it I usually despise singing and dancing in movies but in this film it put a smile on my face Not just because it was amusing to watch but because these people can actually perform really well on these fronts It goes without saying that the music for this film was on point as well I highly recommend everyone to go see this film though maybe dont watch it directly before or after Oppenheimer in case you re following the current trend Let both films sink in for a bit because they each deserve the attention out of this Was this in to,8.0,21 July 2023,0.9932

Funny and sharp first half boring and baffling second one I had great expectations for the Barbie movie mainly because of the writers Greta Ger wig and Noah Baum bach and the stellar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the way Unfortunately I myself disappointed bored and shocked by some messages the movie tries to convey Starting with what I liked the performances were great and in particular Ryan Gosling was spectacular with a wide range of emotions and a lot of humor displayed Also the design of the sets was inspired with a lot of references to the Barbie world and the style was unique and recognisable Finally some jokes landed pretty well and the movie in the first half is pretty funny And the positives end here Unfortunately the negatives are much more important Sorted in a order of increasing gravity some plot lines are bad and are closed so quickly that it would have been better not to include them in the first place In particular I am referring to the mother daughter one and the one about Furthermore the one is also a bit strange since it is useful to criticise however uses feminism to make money while being a movie that does exactly that the film becomes boring in the second half This is due to a systematic shift in tone and style since if in the first part the satire is sharp and elegant and leads to numerous bittersweet laughs in the second half instead the movie becomes full of exposition There are a lot of scenes where things are directly explained to the viewer clearly considered a bit stupid and there are some too long monologues that are both cringe and painfully written This is a pity because some ideas explored in the second half are interesting but due to this shift Barbie becomes so boring to enjoy them the messages I some messages the movie is trying to convey pretty baffling First of all the film is not about parity but rather about gender fight and I dont think this is the correct idea to give to younger viewers I want that children young adults get that as a society we want equal rights and opportunities not to fight to be the dominant gene re This is also true because of the fact that there s no a single positive male figure throughout the movie because they are all treated like enemies or like total idiots On the other side the are perfect entities In a certain way it seemed Birds of Prey where the situation was exactly the same but in that case there were nt two of the biggest writer in Hollywood behind Not to mention the totally worst thing that is how the Barbie solve the main conflict instead of using intelligence they use seduction This is so wrong because in a movie that wants to be empowering women are depicted as better suited in seducing instead of thinking All of these ruin other good ideas like for instance the in version of the point of view that is useful to explain to men what women in our society has to live every day That was pretty interesting but it gets lost between what mentioned before In conclusion I was very disappointed by the Barbie movie because I actually had high hopes knowing that it could have been a fun movie with positive messages but it was the total opposite Ive seen it with both females and males and the reactions were generally mixed and no gender pattern was evidenced in terms of appreciating it or not However the great merit that I have to give credit to the movie is that it triggers a discussion capable of actually enrich people through sharing of experiences And so even if I didnt like it Id suggest you to watch Barbie and discuss of it with your families and friends out of this Was this in to,4.0,25 July 2023,0.9975

The Most Moving Film Ive Ever Seen nicholas z in Im not even joking when I say this was the most moving film Ive ever seen Going into this I expected the outcome to be one of two things either is was going to be very dumb and bad or it would be absolutely amazing No in between And now I can confidently say that it was absolutely amazing It made me laugh it made me tear up it made me feel so much more than I ever could have expected a movie about or any toys in general to make me feel I genuinely believe that it is going to be one of the most influential movies of this generation Before I get into why specifically I loved it so much I would like to first say that to the men out there that are calling this movie man hating you could not be more wrong If you think that then clearly you went in with your own preconceived notions and did not pay enough attention to the message of the movie I also am a man and this movie delivered a beautifully written feminist message that depicted unfair societal stereotypes placed on to women and proved the reasons why the patriarchy is truly a bad thing Just because it did that does not make it man hating especially since it also depicted and drew awareness to negative societal pressure placed on to men and their emotions Now on to why I really loved this movie First off it was very funny and light hearted at exactly the right points I liked that it left room for dramatic scenes that could really tug at the heart strings and Margot Robbie in particular delivered a very powerful performance Yes she had great comedic timing but her talent really showed in more emotional scenes where Barbie felt she had to still act like her happy smiley self despite the overwhelming sadness she was feeling Not only that but the costumes and sets were immaculate It was not only well written and acted but clearly a lot of care went into the movie from the crew Each character even despite their limited screen time was fleshed out and everyone did a great job making their characters unique and different from each other This movie made me think so much I had to let it fester in my brain for a few days before writing a because I had so many thoughts I know many people wished it was more light hearted at times but I am so glad it wasnt because if it was it never could have been as powerful and emotional for me The writers and directors could have taken a more silly childish approach but instead they decided upon a story that could make the world a better place and I have to commend that Overall the Barbie Movie was so much more than I ever could have expected it to be and I urge anyone who has nt yet to go watch it especially if you have an open mind and most importantly an open heart As of right now my rating is a but I definitely think it will increase once I inevitably watch it again I think this movie has the potential to do a lot of good for the world out of this Was this in to,9.0,23 July 2023,0.9979

Welcome to the Dollhouse a cie ssi Barbie the symbol of pink pastel perfection An iconic piece of American pop culture for more than years But nothing can prepare you for her big screen debut Barbie is a risky and courageous new movie This is a film that will be discussed and talked about for years to come Greta Ger wig takes Mate ls historic creation every triumph and failure in its catalogue and places it all within a complicated and challenging critique of what it means to be a woman If I could compare it to another movie I would say its very reminiscent of Robert Hollywood Shuffle It leaves you wondering what kind of insane negotiations went between the creative team and Mate l who is also one the targets of the purposeful ire It is one thing to have completed this film and absolutely another for it to have also gotten the overwhelming promotional campaign in the months leading up to its release Ger wigs bet is paying off big time and you have to admit that takes a lot of guts Concept alone certainly isnt the only strength The film is beautiful to look at The production design is second to none in its meticulous construction of a real life Barbie paradise Respectively Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling give fantastic performances with plenty of complexity and dimension I was the most touched by Rhea Perlman who gives a heartwarming portrayal of the founding mother of Barbie land Ruth Handler Ger wig and Baum b screenplay is biting and irreverent and by the end nobody is left unscathed But equally so I belly laughed quite often and marveled at how well so many of the jokes land The emotional depth of the film also struck a very powerful cord complete with an ending montage that can practically leave anyone misty eyed Having been released on the same day as Oppenheimer its safe to say that the event movie is back and better than ever After three years of streaming it cant be overstated how wonderful that is out of this Was this in to,8.0,25 July 2023,0.996
Barbie is fun but gets too focused on the social commentary and does not do the plot justice s has an Barbie was a very fun light hearted over the top movie that takes you on a wild journey The fact that it paid homage to A Space opening sequence earned it extra points for me Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast and the production design was fantastic A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines This may get some backlash but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom Just because a movie talks about issues you care about however important they may be doesnt mean its the greatest movie of all time and Oscar worthy etc The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didnt give the creative plot idea enough justice Movies dont have to be so explicit with the social commentary as shown by movies like Angry Men which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today At certain times Barbie really blurred the line between being anti patriarchy and being anti men It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice although not throughout out of this Was this in to,7.0,23 July 2023,0.9974

Better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch kevin robbins Barbie is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters last night The storyline follows Barbie in a perfect world who believes she is the perfect role model for little girls in the real world When things start feeling off for her in her world she discovers she may need to go to the real world to set things right When she gets to the real world she discovers how wrong she was about being the perfect role model This movie is directed by Greta Ger wig Little Women and stars Margot Robbie Suicide Squad Is s a Rae Insecure Kathryn McKinnon Bombshell Ryan Gosling The Notebook Alexandra Shipp X Men Apocalypse and Will Ferrell Elf This movie had a lot more going for it than I anticipated The universe and characters are very well developed thoroughly put together with the history of the Barbie universe incorporated and a smart scripts The dialogue and interactions were much deeper than I anticipated There were a lot of good messages and lessons baked into the storyline My only complaint was how much focus there was on the He was a worthwhile villain but the ending dance scene and finding self moment was overdone however everything about the Barbie plot hit the nail on the head Overall this is better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch I would score this a and strongly recommend it out of this Was this in to,7.0,21 July 2023,0.9674

I didnt like it but it was still a masterpieces mr at This movie was an aesthetic dream Just looking at it was a treat Scene to scene color schemes outfit choices This kept you drawn in and you wanted to keep looking even if you didnt like anything else the straight up visual was worth it The satire and political commentary was absolutely on point This movie didnt try to hide what it was or what it was doing it showed you trailer to finish and I loved that There was nothing put in by accident everything was thoughtful and served a purpose This was true for every joke every clothing choice every character every emotion The humor was funny but this was my one complaint I dont like crude humor and I am a prude and honestly some of it was crass Nothing bad and I recognize I am a grinch in that way I laughed but this was the reason I would not watch it over and over just dont value that type of joke But I recognize and respect the writing and it was very important to the movie The casting and acting INCREDIBLE I mean really every single person was better than the next Margot Robbie was absolutely incredible Every single supporting cast member was so well casted and acted America Ferrara was amazing and her monologue was probably the highlight of the film and the most powerful part every woman every person can relate in some way if not all ways Hats off to Greta for this film she took and assignment and got an A and then earned some extra credit one of the great directors Great film and I respect it so much as a film doesnt mean I have to love watching it that s what for me makes it an instead of a but honestly it probably deserves an IGo see it its absolutely worth it out of this Was this in to,8.0,27 July 2023,0.9988

Clever dazzling but somewhat incoherent bob yule On the plus side this was an ambitious dazzling film with what I felt was an original concept It explored the world of gender stereotyping and male female relationships using the world of Barbie and Ken as its base point There was a strong feminist theme running through it but I did not find this overwhelming Whilst the male figures were often portrayed as stupid and one dimensional this was done with some wit and indeed affection The action migrated between the real world and the mythical world of Barbie and so perhaps it was no surprise that the plot tended to meander and remained unconvincing The energy of the film was sustained by the comedy and the zaniness of the characters I differ from some critics in that I thought the best performance came from Margot Robbie as Barbie Her character bounced between parody and realism but she managed the demands well I thought that the much acclaimed Ryan Gosling tended to over act and his character became annoying This may be down to my age and my English ness but I was unable to make out the detail of the many snappy one liners that were delivered The young and the American will probably not have this trouble Though likeable and even moving in places altogether this film felt like less than the sum of its parts Its attempts at juggling comedy and serious themes fantasy and reality were not ultimately successful and it became incoherent and lacking in some kind of unity Ultimately for me the acid test of a film is the issue of whether or when I start wanting it to end I made to about two thirds of the way through out of this Was this in to,6.0,26 July 2023,0.9724

Barbie Unspeakably Bad jonathan rua no I am not surprised in the least that the Barbie movie is trash and a truly deplorable career choice by Margot Robbie who will probably be type cast forever in Barbie type roles To begin with there is just too much pink and superficiality for this movie to inspire anything more than groans and watching your watch waiting for the whole travesty to be over The plot is completely by the numbers as Barbie has the perfect life in Barbie World Then suddenly she yearns to see the real world Where did we see that storyline before Lets see I know The Little Mermaid and a hundred other movies ripping off the same plot But if that s not bad enough we have to s it through dreary dialogue such as Ken wanting to sleep over with Barbie while being totally innocent of sex and the fairy god mother pressuring Barbie to reject the high heels in order to seek enlightenment as if Barbie should not make the choice on her own without somebody prodding her in a particular direction Even the people who like it cant point to anything original in it Where that comes from is beyond me out of this Was this in to,2.0,21 July 2023,0.7602
Be what you want to be Mateo EG C Ryan Gosling as Ken I loved too much but Margot Robbie as Barbie is perfect I understood the message very well its great to see how they destroy little by little the stereotypes of a pretty person and replace it with the reality that many human beings live And after all men and women and every living being deserve to be happy One of the scenes I loved aside from the opening reference is the Just Ken Exclusive scene I would have loved to see more of Ken And dont forget that you can be whatever you want to be By the way I absolutely hated the advertising to a certain car brand out of this Was this in to,8.0,20 July 2023,0.9869

It swings and it hits draw life BARBIE HE I MER is among us Between BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER releasing on the same week the wife really wanted to see this first and I obliged BARBIE is definitely bound to have some divisiveness due to its feminism and yes a lot of feminism honestly what did you expect Not addressing this is like not addressing the nuclear bomb in OPPENHEIMER For a movie about a childrens toy I got to give it some kudos for its subversion and tying to put out a message this big Im not shocked that the film focused a bit more on the reality elements of the real world as opposed to the fantasy side A lot of that is because this is a Greta Ger wig film co written with her partner Noah Baum bach and she is one of the best working director writer today The unconventional approach is something to admire The film swings with these metaphysical ideas and existential crisis The performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling carry the film Robbie tackles the role very well The story asks her to do a lot and Robbie showcases awakening with sincerity terror confusion naivety humor and bittersweet acceptance Gosling gets to cut loose and be funny He goes on his own journey to discovering who he is so there s layers to his Ken as well He also has a funny rivalry banter with S imu Ken Rest of the supporting cast are a bit underdeveloped but they get moments to shine here and there and serve the plot in motion Some highlights are Kingsley Ben A dir Is s a Rae Michael Cera and Kate McKinnon America Ferrara and Ariana Green blatt are the human mother daughter duo in the film character delivers a monolog that is very on the nose and at that point you re with it or about it For me personally I honestly dont mind it as long as its entertaining and to the credit it was for at least the first act of the film Its at its best with the self aware meta humor but eventually the film gets too carried away and takes itself too seriously loosing its humor and leaving us experiencing moments that are a bit of a chore to s it through One could say it was refreshing to watch an incredibly self aware film that isnt afraid to be bold in its message but for me while I agree with the underlying message its very heavy handed and preachy I connected more when the film explored the nature of character There s one scene that tackles legacy directly that raised the existential crisis for her but it isnt revisited in favor of telling a bigger societal story Production design the sets and visuals are very well done Shout out to production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorators Katie Spencer I feel like Barbie could take home the Oscar for production design When you re in Barbie Land the overall usage of pink and the plastic feel makes the whole experience feel i Cinematography by Rodrigo makes the film feel like you re there It has a vibrant and inviting energy that you cant help but gaze at I am curious how some families who saw the film feel about it as some might have expected a more straight forward approach as opposed to this more nuanced subversive take but I think overall the film is destined to be enjoyed overall and successful It just might get a sequel if it can rake in the money which it looks like it will As a male this film isnt made for me Im obviously not the target audience for it However the film did enough to make me feel engaged where I laughed at some jokes but the second half is where I felt the film was talking at me instead of engaging me as a viewer It flirts with being a unique fantasy real world introspective story but then seems to be more interested in making a point by the end of it out of this Was this in to,6.0,22 July 2023,0.9978
Barbie A Comedy Film with Something to Say Pictures in flow Barbie is a film that revolves around fun and enjoyment The story centers on our titular character Barbie in her world full of pink numerous other and Kens unique rules and a repetitive daily routine The movie overflows with laughter clever remarks musical numbers dazzling sets existential crises and much more Margot Robbie portraying Barbie and Ryan Gosling playing Ken thoroughly embodied their roles to the fullest As the main character in her world Barbie is admired by everyone and sought after for attention She must adhere to the Stereotypical Barbie image with flawless perfection which can become exhausting over time On the other hand Ken serves as the placeholder character for the public and with his dry humor he delivers the majority of laughs throughout the film showcasing his unwavering adoration for Barbie Director Greta Ger wig known for her unique storytelling showcases her creativity once again in Barbie The dialogue is woven in a way that allows for multiple interpretations enabling Barbie to discuss her own world and even extend beyond it The movie transcends the boundaries of a typical comedy at times and addresses issues that resonate in our own world The bold choice of including a reference to A Space Odyssey before the actual start sets an enthralling mood The film initially feels like an episode from the Twilight Zone with the repeating day trope but gradually reveals something amiss These daring choices elevate Barbie from being just another comedy movie to a film with a deliberate vision Barbie slightly teeters on the edge of delivering patriarchal messages especially towards the end but it manages to steer clear of crossing the line As one of the original feminist icons since her creation in certain types of comments were inevitable The movie addresses these issues with eloquence all while remembering its primary purpose is to entertain and offer an escape to a fictional world The marketing strategy for Barbie is nothing short of brilliant Pairing it with Oppenheimer a drastically different film for a double feature is a stroke of genius Viewers have the choice to immerse themselves first in the bubbly and joyful world of Barbie followed by the thought provoking story of Oppenheimer The success of this marketing approach is evident in the box office results as many attendees opted for both screenings turning it into a global film festival with two back to back films The production design as showcased in the dazzling trailers is impeccable packed with intricate details easter eggs various era and Kens and more The commitment put into cu rating these elements from different years and presenting them in an engaging manner is commendable Barbie arrives at an interesting time with both writers and actors on strike and Hollywood on the verge of temporary closure However the combination of Barbie and Oppenheimer offers audiences a choice and a break from the usual superhero or unnecessary sequel movies Barbie delivers abundant laughter lively music outstanding performances and takes viewers on an immensely enjoyable journey out of this Was this in to,7.0,28 July 2023,0.998

Loved The Barbie Doll As A kid Loved The Barbie Movie As An AdultS AM THE BEST EST Barbie Movie Review Barbie Review Greta Ger wigs Barbie movie is a breezy funny pinky and girly Ride Into Barbie land These four soft adjectives are enough to describe the Barbie movie Greta Ger wig takes us into Barbie land with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling to deliver a possible fantasy that we all dreamed of as children or as adults Being a boy I couldnt have a Barbie doll in my childhood but I did have a close look at her with my female cousins playing with her doing make up dress up and all the girly stuff And I dont think any boy is unaware of Barbie and Ken even if he has nt played with them in childhood Its a fascination for us and a dream come true for girls I am not at all hesitant to admit that if I were a girl I would have enjoyed this movie more than I actually did as a boy Nevertheless I enjoyed it and that s more than enough for social media gender ego system Barbie begins with the inception of Barbie and how she appeared on earth if we call it that in this fantasy movie This very scene is a lot of fun when you see Margot Robbie appearing in black and white checks in one piece and little girls breaking their dolls into pieces Soon we are transported into Barbie Land where all are living happily All the women are self confident working in top positions successful and enjoying life to the fullest while all Kens are jobless and do nothing but try to mingle with Our stereotypical Barbie Robbie suddenly begins to dysfunction and sense the morality of human life She has to travel to the human world to find out who the child is who is calling her to be there Obviously Ken Gosling forces his company on her However things go wrong for Barbie in the real world where she realises she is not loved anymore whereas Ken finds a motto of patriarchy Ken returns and takes over Barbie land by persuading other Kens and brainwashing the rest of the babies there Here distraught Barbie finds Gloria America a employee who is the catalyst of her existential crisis Gloria began playing with her daughter Ariana Green blatt Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis inadvertently transferring her concerns to Stereotypical Barbie Gloria restores Barbie and then they take off on a mission to bring back all Its been a while since we have seen a good budget comedy movie so Barbie certainly ends the dry spell I mean this one is a fun ride from start to end It may be a little childish oh that s a bad word lets say child friendly but its damn funny The humour is girlish yes but I liked it too From Zack Snyder The Godfather cautionary note on casting to slapstick one liners Barbie is such a colourful comedy It does not look like an intelligent film rather it stages itself as a crazy comedy That s one of the points Id say went wrong in the climax These characters arent supposed to be smart but they intend to be when it comes to ending the show Why Toy Story had the simple but subtle philosophy that a toy should be a toy for a lifetime It may have many owners but its job is to stick to them and be loyal because that s why we humans love them Barbie challenges this universally accepted theory and goes against the tide Now whether its good or bad I leave that choice to you since my personal opinion isnt very affirmative about this theory Barbie was meant to be a career defining role for Margot Robbie and she made sure that you d remember her forever as Barbie I kept looking for a single frame where she would not look pretty and I couldnt find it for minutes I melted man Ryan Ken is the funniest character in the whole movie That cute flirting those reluctant expressions jealousy arrogance and at last self discovery this man has lived the character Kate weird Barbie appears for a short time but serves enough Other babies including Is s a Rae Ne f Alexandra Shipp Emma Mackay Du a Lip a Sharon Rooney An a Cruz Kayne Rit u Arya and Nicola are all gorgeous On the other hand Kingsley Ben A dir Scott Evans S imu Liu Rob B on N cut i Ga twa and John as Kens add fine support Michael Cera Ariana Green blatt and Will Ferrell pass the time well while Rhea cameo is blasting The biggest cheer in the Barbie movie came for America monologue which describes the struggle and victory of feminism Ariana Green blatt steals the show in the first and the rest of the cast has done well Made on a budget of million Barbie is a lavish big screen entertainer as the production design makes sure you feel the fantasy right Those f items could have been excluded but having them there is kind of fun in itself Who s to blame Rodrigo camera does the talking with close ups and long shots of Barbie and Ken Barbie does not have any loo breaks courtesy of Nick ys superb editing and the music is lovable Some people often say that a female director and female pair is something else and I have to accept that Barbie could have been a lot less under w hel ming without Greta Ger wig This woman has made a world that is so adorable and so rummy A few flaws are there in the script and the characters but since we are not discussing an artistic masterpiece of cinema lets Chuck that discussion Lets enjoy this pinky and girly entertainer which is sure to take female audiences by storm and leave a good enough impact on men too Not to forget who s writing it RATING out of this Was this in to,6.0,21 July 2023,0.9992

I hated Barbie Now there is the film poster in my room J Granger I have never been a fan of Barbie I her too pink too clich d until I watched this film As the trailer suggested this movie is for people who hate the legendary doll so I gave it a shot It was worth it I seldom had that much fun in cinema Barbie lives her happy life in Barbie land but as she develops a human consciousness she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality This movie is so much more than just funny as it is political and not predictable It discusses the influence of the doll on young girls It criticizes stereotypical body while acknowledging her for revolutionizing the way girls saw themselves Because Barbie can be anything girls can be anything is said throughout the film As Barbie taught girls to be more than just mothers this is true Margot Robbie has proved what a great actress she is That makes her the perfect cast for Barbie as you take her seriously and sympathize with her Ryan Gosling as her counterpart is equally fitting He provides the film with a great sense of humor that will leave you laughing out loud All in all Barbie differs from the majority of movies that are produced in Hollywood right now as it is refreshingly new funny and surprising Director and author Greta Ger wig has done a great job creating this hilarious summer movie out of this Was this in to,9.0,21 July 2023,0.9945

Many Will Go Most Will Enjoy Sarah Having just watched a woman drag her tween daughter out of the movie trailed along a bit after by a couple of older sorts I can tell you this movie is not what some people have envisioned It is not a light hearted childrens film It is PG for a reason and also if you have nt taught your daughter the word patriarchy yet that might be something to cover first Second its not a paean to the Barbie doll Barbie collectors or as a corporation Honestly Im not sure how they re signed on as producers except perhaps to prove the point that the corporation is all about a cash grab The execs come across as buffoons and their talking points about being there for little girls are definitely shredded in the early encounters No room to come back So while many went into the theater this weekend expecting a fun movie not everyone will enjoy the show I personally thought it was ok not as grand as expected but I got to the end well enough The acting was the fun part especially Ryan Gosling as the air headed and thwarted Ken voice of male fragility Songs are catchy ear worms The sets are marvelous pop art pink and scaled to make things look doll like The plot is a weak point Ill admit being very simplistic Honestly however I kind of expected that So unlike the women above neither stomped nor snuck out Mainly the message is to crush the patriarchy ok but where is role in this patriarchy and why is a pregnant Midge so looked down on even now And since the ending sees theoretically still ram ping production what did we actually learn from this messaging anyhow If the pitch was to be a pivot to a modernized Barbie Im not sure that marketing campaign did any favors And if it was that humanism is more important than corporate greed the associated marketing mer ch kind of undercut the message too At any rate the director al easter eggs kept me going through all of it call back cinematic opening is just the start So there s good news and bad news and maybe its cost sunk fallacy making me give the film a seven But I thought it was OK so here we are out of this Was this in to,7.0,24 July 2023,0.9652

Pink Political Power is Fun Funny At Times Deep But Aggressively Weird rg karim LIKES The Setting It feels like a Barbie world in real life and captures the energy of the doll in all glory Plenty of accessories the plastic feeling and the toy like atmosphere with real life people is totally captured and super fun The real world is fine and does the job of acting as the second world but its really Barbie land that excels in the feeling of bringing it to life The Plots Originality Yes much of it is predictable and familiar but there is more to it than meets the eye plot is one part comedy one part discovery and one part political philosophy that sort of gives you a variety I wasnt expecting It may feel a little out there but points for trying to be different and more advanced than many other stories have attempted The Acting McKinnon may have been used too much but I loved her in this film for the way her weirdness works for weird Barbie Quirky fun a little bold but that line delivery that really works for delivering lines Rae is fine for when she is on screen She s got a few dynamics that her monotone delivery works with what you got but to get top bill first bill doesnt make sense to me Ryan Gosling works well in t eh roles and for his direction a supporting actor role nomination feels good for me He s clumsy funny hardcore silly and it works for the ridiculous nature and tone of the movie And for Margot Robbie the woman continues to knock the ball out of the park for how amazing she fits the role She s sparkly quirky but has a range that she just brings Ger wig brought some new elements out in terms of representation thought maybe not the Oscar performance like some call for The Comedy At Times The movie does have general jokes that worked very well for me well timed moments that were perfect for breaking the moment Satire to a point was amazing at times at how much fun they had with certain concepts The design of Barbie dolls that failed or the fact of fashion drawing eyes and even certain trends that we love It was clever balanced and had this timing delivery that worked Some of the Ken lines were funny the fact that I was like classic Patrick from was very fun especially when sometimes paired with one of the other style of jokes And Helen narration was the funniest component for me Her dry delivery the classy sass and the fact the woman just sells the lines was my favorite part in terms of laughs and wished there had been more As such the comedy did work at times for me The Pace Its two hours long but for the most part doesnt feel it and that goes to the fun pacing Barbie starts out fun exciting and pops into the adventure with a lot of energy Then that energy sort of stays but hunkers down a bit never losing the whimsy but finding a means to feel entertaining and somewhat engaging That is the superior quality of this movie compared to the other big one that engaging pace and just having fun The Music By far the music is what works the best for me in this movie and tells so much and brings so much energy in the track list The songs from the radio and the past work well comedic devices that were quite honestly some of the best jokes for me with several of the characters Other songs are fun musical numbers that work dance numbers full of pop vibe or later a true stage show musical that had the the at ric s and jazz of a stage show As for the new songs that were made for the movie they were my favorite Remixes of Barbie girl an exposition song and reprise and a few other numbers just have so much character that it really added points for me in terms of just how much fun Barbie can be The Message There is a very deep message to this movie and to be honest I did enjoy this part of Ger wigs writing Its deep has character development and really drives home a lot of social commentary and trends under the microscope about human qualities I liked how it was built in and the dialog to embrace it and just wished this movie had kept that in line with me DISLIKES The Fun Vibes Take a Detour I just said the pace was good and there was an energy but the fun part did take a detour the further you went into the film Ger wig is a very unique writer and once she got her hooks into her political writing there were times where the first part of the fun was lost to very agenda heavy writing I t felt a bit forced for me and I longed for more numbers a little adventure and a little less banter beating the dead horse that the film went Throw in the darker aspects of the agenda and losing that fun at the beginning was not what I would have liked to see for most of the movie Ger wigs Hyper Agenda I get this is who she is but Ive seen movies where that side of her is toned down and we get a much deeper character drama But Barbie Barbie pulls no punches and berates you with very in your face no holds bar rather excessive and in some cases insulting humor that I got tired of There were times where that line was perfect and the story quality maximized but most of the movie failed that balance and she did not seem sorry for what I felt was a tad too toxic for my liking If you are a fan of this type of hyper writing then you are in great shape but for those like me who are tired of movies becoming agenda venting this movie is going to lose points for being annoying and simplistic and losing the creative spark The Stupidity The movie has a smart writer and so seeing so much ridiculous silliness in one movie to contradict the smart writing didnt accomplish much for me Will direction was one of these moments where he was a straight up idiot saying weird things that were more awkward and uncomfortable than funny for me His little montage was just really dumb and to the point it stuck out a bit too much Meanwhile handling was fine being a moron but Ger wigs political writing sort of didnt do much for me as rather than improving and becoming elevated like his counterpart sort of grew toxic level stupid That excessive ness again just doesnt work when I saw those sparkling moments that show where everything comes together instead of feeling like an adult version of a Disney Channel Original movie The Character Usage is odd The movie is trying to balance a lot of names and characters and it only works on that half of the time Barbie has too many characters and some of the people I expected to have more time were limited than I anticipated and quite honestly a political tool They do their work but its just missing balance and full use and I think its relying too much on a sequel and people just happy with being comedic props and line spew ers than anything else The Story Is All Over The Place My fellow reviewers are right its a weird story and it is all over the place This might give it the unique twist but tale is a jumble of lots of different feels and the at ric s that sort of work together but feel messily put together One level is like I said fun bright and feels like a dance party meets on stage musical that works to an extent The second then becomes this dive into the psyche mixed with somehow co medically stupid gimmicks to try and keep entertaining going Third then goes metaphysical and really deep and it kind of works but then goes really odd and sort of trip py to a way Im still trying to process Ger wigs writing is always deeper and more complex but this might have tried to be a bit too ambitious for its own good for me and felt just so scrambled and very much in your face for plot telling The VERDICT Barbie is a venue that I really did have some fun with and was surprised by the unexpected things it had to offer and the clever writing I had hoped would shine in A geek like me knowing the references appreciating the pokes to it and the fun timing of some well written lines that had me laughing in the theater I loved the acting loved the set and just loved a lot of the vibes of the less agenda writing really worked for me and will appeal to many of the general group And the music whew really loved it and the energy and storytelling it did which was very good for me But the movie did not appeal to me in that Ger wig seemed to reach too high for being unique and elevated leading to moments that just dont appeal to a reviewer like me The detour of fun for very politically heavy writing was probably my least favorite aspect losing the killer vibes and balanced fun and humor with a very polarized way of thinking was not my cup of tea In addition the story elements and character usage felt a bit jumbled scrambled shallow and having too many character moments to really show off Ger wigs better writing Thus when balancing this out my score for this movie is that its a theater worthy film for a lot of

A Barbie World ba harper writes I am so torn on this movie There is no doubt that Barbie is beautifully made movie with an awesome cast and an amazing creative team Mar go Robbie was born to play Barbie and lets be honest Ryan Gosling stole the entire movie Then again I cant think of a single cast Member I didnt like The references are amazing as a boy with a sister I grew with Barbie so I recognised a lot things But I did not care for the writing and some of the movies messages were not just bad but problematic I was going to go into details about all the things that bothered me but Im not spoiling anything I dont hate this movie by any means but I dont love it either I think the target audience will love it and lets be honest that s not me out of this Was this in to,6.0,21 July 2023,0.1687
Only thing that saved this was good acting and sound track j jank el Honestly not too sure what my partner and I were expecting but we figured it would be a fun empowering and sweet movie Instead we got a preachy confused mess that oscillated between comedy and social commentary in a wildly jarring way Unfortunately I think the writers took the opportunity to project their feelings on to the audience The message seems dated and naive At best its a bit of an eye roll at worst its an attempt to shame young girls into a self defeating thought process Acting sound track set design and some bits of comedy were really good and there is some genuine cinema in there out of this Was this in to,5.0,22 July 2023,0.8186
Just enjoy it Its funny j collins First off Im a year old white male and this movie wasnt even made for me If your at all interested then go see this movie Its funny It has a lot of funny lines and scenes The recreation of the set is incredible but maybe a little vi dual indigestion You adapt quickly The characters are really good Perfect for what they are expected to be Both the main Barbie and Ken are excellently portrayed There is a feminist overtone but there is no lack of irony and mockery of both sexes No one is asking you to be moved or to change your political or other persuasion Just relax and enjoy it as a comedy The people who criticize this movie for political or macho reasons are way out of bounds and are too easily swayed by political environment This move is a funny comedy that might actually open your eyes to a feminist point of view of you choose to absorb it If not you ll still laugh and call it a good time out of this Was this in to,7.0,23 July 2023,0.9917

Pleasantly surprised but maybe its a bit too much Limbo I went to see this movie without even seeing the trailer first Im a yo man and people kept posting stuff about this movie on social media so when a friend asked me to go watch it I said yes I was expecting some kind of dumb movie but this is not It appeals to teenagers but also to an older audience I loved the sense of humor was sometimes laughing at themselves too I that very nicely done The acting is amazing However I liked the first part of the movie more than the second one It starts to analyze the patriarchy a bit too heavily for my taste They want to make it clear that this is a feminist movie They want to clear image of the stereotypes she s been associated with for decades she s not a blonde and skinny perfect bimbo girl Barbie is a feminist she represents empowered women I keep questioning myself about this point of view little girls have been associating the idea of beauty with Barbie for so long so my idea of Barbie has been quite the opposite throughout my life I find it hard to accept it Now lets talk about Ken He only exists because Barbie exists In Barbie Land he counts nothing There is a deep criticism toward the patriarchy which I can understand but goes slightly too far for my taste out of this Was this in to,7.0,28 July 2023,0.9942
Barbie Not For Me But Its Fine For What It Is CutlasS This probably wouldnt come off as a shocker to anyone who knows me but Im definitely not the target audience for this film That doesnt mean I dislike the film in anyway just thought that would be an important thing to point out before actually reviewing this film Surprisingly the movie wasnt generic or filled with over the top clich es and judging from the trailer I thought Id have seen this story play out so many times before I mainly expected it to depend on its humor which is probably the only thing that lived up to my expectations because Im a way it kind of did It actually had a compelling message that had decent pacing to lead up to that message obviously the message wasnt directed towards me in any way but to young girls who struggle with these issues that s not to say the message is bad or anything I just cant say much about a message that s not even directed towards me Without Ryan Gosling I probably wouldnt have enjoyed this film as much as I did Im definitely not saying the other actors were completely horrible in there role because its quite the opposite I just dont think it lived up to performance to me I like Margot Robbie as an actress and I think she does a great job for this role And for the most part a lot of the actors here were great too of course If I had to come up with one negative for this film maybe the gender roles thing was a little preachy but honestly it doesnt bother me nearly as much as most films handle this subject Ive seen how completely woke certain films can be and its not nearly as bad as the way this film handles it so I cant really be too upset about it Other than that this is a film you cant really take seriously because its a comedy All I can say is this movie was fine but definitely not for me and that s ok out of this Was this in to,7.0,23 July 2023,0.9819

A shrewd satire ca too Is Barbie a shrewd satire Despite the existence of two divided factions in this case men versus women which is somewhat comical given that the dispute revolves around whether message is correct or not the film can be appreciated by both female and male audiences The work addresses highly delicate themes that are complicated to consider in society as they inevitably generate controversy Nevertheless the film achieves this with a genuinely humorous approach inserting clever jokes in moments where the plot becomes dense interrupting the atmosphere and eliciting laughter from a significant portion of the audience Personally while experiencing this situation I was one of the few gentlemen who attended the screening individually surrounded by women and I delighted in the subtly acidic references and humor about current affairs I greatly enjoyed how the film incorporates references to other cinematic classics such as A Space Odyssey and The Godfather two films that are historically revered as some of the best of all time Moreover the work addresses contemporary controversies such as patriarchy feminism and the stereotypes imposed on bodies deemed perfect I wont delve into the details of the plot as it unfolds linearly as expected in this film Its development is solid and fitting focused on a main objective of exposing the marked contrast between our cultural reality and a fictional dimension imbued with idealized visions I must express my surprise at this creation since it was expected that it would merely promote a new collection of Barbie dolls or evoke superficial nostalgia yet it turned out to be precisely the opposite One aspect that I would like to emphasize is the careful selection of actors where Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling embody the stereotype of beauty both female and male that society deems perfect Both actors in their respective roles present themselves as vulnerable to various challenges inherent to their genders The film conveys a message that despite possessing a body considered perfect or conforming to the Barbie stereotypes it does not negate the possibility of experiencing distress sadness fatigue from wearing heels or confronting the presence of ultimately preventing us from being everything we aspire to be This message intertwines with the reality of women in modern times addressing the complexities and challenges they face in their daily lives The film fulfills its objective by serving as a critique of society admittedly leaning towards an unfavorable perspective on the male gender while taking for granted the superiority of the female gender As a man I personally was not offended by the jokes directed at the male gender in the film on the contrary I appreciated how the film vividly portrays the simplicity happiness and lack of complications that we as men can achieve Without further a do adorned with a rosy hue and brief musical moments that do not overwhelm adding to experience even though it is targeted at a specific audience it proves to be exceptionally enjoyable Therefore I wholeheartedly recommend it After all who wouldnt want to laugh at themselves while acknowledging our human nature filled with imperfections out of this Was this in to,8.0,25 July 2023,0.9961

Wolf in Clothing luke ll This film thinks its the Lego Movie but is far more akin to Dont Worry Darling Starting off in a Matriarchal society s feminist paradise where every position in society is ran by women this is never shown as oppressive or questionable saturated with the neon pinks and pastel purples quint essentially American and girly All Kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and s imp over Barbie Through the course of the film this paradigm is spun on its head and put back to how it was again no fantastic al change happens to this world once it is changed and fought over and won back again by the Vapid and confused are just a few words to sum up this movie Mis andris t should be just as common as misogynist in vocabulary if any film of this generation portrayed women as servile useless and toxic it would be slammed across the board However in this film woman are both victorious and the victim the oppressed and oppressor the can have s and the cannot s Barbie wants its pink empowered cake and wants to eat it too I didnt expect a pro masculine message from a Barbie movie but I also didnt expect this when asked to accompany my girlfriend I would also never expect any woman to s it through a film that took swings and berated their gender Is this movie harmful Yes a generation will be brought up to hate their fathers brothers and even sons This burns bridges rather than mends them or creates new ones It feels like a trojan horse when compared to its advertising Many will tell you it has brains is well written and is a fascinating commentary on society some of that may be true Though if truth be told it is a confused and confusing film A feminist utopia would have women in every possible position in society and shocked to see there were construction however that no building had exterior walls or any use of windows I dont know what this says but the optics dont look well The fantasy land portrayed is truly fantasy and I hope every viewer realises that out of this Was this in to,5.0,22 July 2023,0.8621

Cute existentialism J it hindu Barbie is exactly the movie the trailers promised Different from what you expect from a toy adaptation but not fully up to the talents of the writers and director involved An existential comedy for little girls and adults is the best way it can be described Its very well made with the use of extensive sets and amazing actors in it Entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable Great message even if it gets preachy a little bit which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too It also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition The self awareness works to a point too But the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless I mean I get it that only made this so they can sell their toys and was ready for the film to criticise them for the same but do they really have to overcompensate for that like this out of this Was this in to,7.0,21 July 2023,0.9895

Fun filled with depth ruel s hepper d Greta Ger wig has nt missed yet with a film but this film is her first larger budget film Similar to The Lego Movie this film appears to be a harmless funny commercial with a simple message but also like The Lego Movie great writing and performances make it a heartfelt film with strong themes and messages The plot is fairly straightforward with our main Barbie going on a journey of self discovery in the real world while Ken does the same A simple premise but well executed The plot deals with themes such as gender equality the loss of childhood and the nature of growing up with such good humour and heart I had a smile on my face the entire time The performances are strongest from the two leads Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling Both bring a lot of energy and life to Barbie and Ken communicating the struggles of being both a man and woman and how one cant exist without the other They have excellent chemistry and both inject their roles with great emotion The rest of the cast are good though some felt unnecessary Will CEO could have benefitted from more screen time or even been cut completely Yet he is still hilarious in the scenes he is in The set design is immaculate Barbie land was a joy to witness My only issue is we spent more time there The score was great and the cinematography further helped with the immersion Production wise this film is gorgeous The only problems are a few too many times of the film hammering its message in to the point it can become annoying There are also a few lines and jokes that dont land at all and seem entirely of the time Yet these are minor in the face that everything does right Overall Barbie is a lot of fun with great comedy and a lot of heart The leads are great the set design is immaculate and the message is strong and positive A fun film that I highly recommend out of this Was this in to,8.0,25 July 2023,0.999
Could it ever meet expectations watch it wombat Barbie Movie Review She s a Barbie girl who is having an existential crisis in the Barbie world Life isnt so fantastic So she decides to head to the real world with Ken because we ve got everything sorted over here right The film highlights the paradox that is Barbie and owns it It would seem that they wrote a pros and cons list and tackled every item on it Was Barbie an astronaut before women were allowed credit cards Yes Has she perpetuated un achievable body image stereotypes Yes Do they address both of these issues and everything in between Even the makers of Barbie and this film arent safe poking fun at their own lack of diversity hiring The experience feels very intimate getting up close with Margot Robbie From the literal extreme close ups to the emotion she manages to give when bringing a kids toy to life Robbie commits to the role but never comes across as d it or dumb growing more with every scene However Ryan Gosling doesnt shift out of cheese ball mode but clearly relishes the chance to ham it up as a Him bo The narration from Helen although brief is one of the highlights Punctuating moments with her dry British wit The message of inequality is prevalent in every line of this film and although its an extremely important message it could have been done without bashing you over the head with it for hours Mums and Dads will love the nostalgia and the occasional double entendre Girls and boys will have fun while hopefully absorbing her not so subtle message By Nick Watch It Wombat out of this Was this in to,6.0,23 July 2023,0.8399
A Good Movie That Should Have Been A Great Movie j george This was a very fun very engaging premise I dont know if Id call it since its a little derivative of Toy Story and Extra Guy but this definitely works The scenery and cast are great and the movie bristles with energy I just wish they kept this a little more light hearted and a little less preachy There are countless movies that lament victim hood and discrimination and countless movies that showcase estranged parents and children magically reuniting through remarkable events But how many great comedies are there these days How about for once just keeping things light and entertaining The patriarchy Seriously Regardless I think most of the audience loved it and I think most of the women wanted to stand up and cheer during the big speech Its a visual feast with just enough laughs and a lot of star power and you will probably be glad you went out of this Was this in to,7.0,22 July 2023,0.995

K enough Synopsis Barbie Played by Margot Robbie suddenly starts to notice that she is slowly turning away from being the stereotypical Barbie doll with a few changes happening to her This forces Barbie to discover the real world as well as herself and her purpose as a doll This film is directed by Greta Ger wig and written by both Greta Ger wig and her partner Noah Baum bach In case you did not know Greta Ger wig is the writer and director of films like Lady Bird and Little Woman Both these films are astonishing in terms of the screenplay and dialogues In addition Noah Baum bach wrote directed and produced Marriage Story as well as Frances Ha that had Greta Ger wig as a lead actress role and a writer in the film Both those films also stood out for mostly the screenplay that is very deep and realistic in terms of the story and dialogues Therefore the expectations of Barbie are very high especially that we are talking about having those big names as the behind this film However the results are unfortunately not near their previous films especially in terms of the screenplay Barbie is a film that is in my opinion targeted mostly for adults It is like the director described a party for everyone and everyone is invited But young kids especially new young generation will feel like its not the type of party for them As well as the jokes that feel like mostly adults will get them especially that some of them include some inappropriate language or idea The biggest flaws of the film are its most important parts and the main story mainly evolves around them Therefore because they were nt done well the film lost its balance at most times Barbie touched on the topic of how a relationship between a mother and a daughter can be and the stages it goes through This is being portrayed in the weakest way ever and that s due to many reasons mainly for not giving it enough time and discussing it very briefly Therefore no emotions or connections are created between both the mothers character and the character with audience members As well as using a young actress to portray the role of the daughter that can be played by someone else with better acting skills Without spoiling but a shorter sequence near the end of the film between irrelevant characters was able to touch audience members hearts in terms of that topic better than the characters of the mother and daughter with their sequences that we spent nearly most of the film with trying to connect with their relationship A huge aspect that had helped in making this sequence a successful one is Billie E il song What was I made for that was playing in the background during it I an interview wit Billie she goes by explaining how this song tells what she went through and felt in an This can be heard in the songs lyrics and voice that makes this scene and song very real and original and goes so well with that scene in particular Another huge flaw is the portrait of the corporation with its executives mainly played by Will Farrell as the CEO of Very weak and cringe at times that just made me rather want to go back to the Barbie Ln ad sequences or Barbie and Ke sequences Margot Robbie is just phenomenal as Barbie exactly like what everyone expected her to be She proves herself as an actress that can be added to the list of one of the most significant actresses in the modern time She is able to play most roles very well and that can be seen from her previous roles like Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood or previously in Babylon as Nil lie Lore y On the other hand Ryan gosling as Ken is shining in this film I think most of the scenes that I laughed out loud in where mostly because of jokes performed by Gosling with the help of his acting skills using facial expressions and body language that suits character and behaviour perfectly S imu Lui proves himself in this film that he is better in comedy films rather than serious action drama films I enjoyed his comedic Ken role here more tHan i enjoyed seeing him being a superhero and trying to play a character like Shang Chu in Shang Chi Greta really uses all the and trends that people have created in regards to the Barbie movie on the different social media platforms and uses them as the main core behind the comedy aspect of the film These little details are what make films all different from each other Also this is what makes Barbie a film made for the fans specifically For instance everyone have seen the that is a picture of the gang from wearing suits and looking very fresh with a caption on it that says tickets for the Barbie movie please This can clearly be seen in the film as many jokes had a similar idea that evolves around those jokes that you would end to your buddy on or One of my favourite lines said by Ryan Ken is Every night is boys night Finally props to all production design custom design and editing team that was able to portray Barbie Land and all the different Barbie and Ken versions exactly how they were suppose to look with their pink and colourful world and customs which is a thing that I personally was worried about The results are more than K ENough My rating is Watched on th Format Ultra AV X out of this Was this in to,8.0,23 July 2023,0.9989
Fun Enough Twee tien at or Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are most charming and superb in their roles as Barbie and Ken Also here and there are some really funny and entertaining scenes but the message you know all that blab la about patriarchy and matriarchy and all the clich es regarding gender from a certain point of view drag the whole movie rather down at least for me For sure the movie is one great coup by the marketing team of to fit and place Barbie World into the currents of st I take any bet the sells will rise these days profoundly Anyway if you are in the mood for comedy and can cope with those preaching elements you may find some entertainment like I did but if you are fed up with such progressive matters you should avoid watching this one Because of Robbie and Gosling and some fine settings and scenes this movie does not crash but Barbie is without doubt just another most hyped affair by the media and the plot rather a very predictable one indeed out of this Was this in to,6.0,22 July 2023,0.9891

An Extremely Clever and Entertaining Experience kj pro ul x Well if a film like The Lego Movie can come out and be clever and great I guess a Barbie film can as well I will always hesitate when a product receives a film based on it because it just seems shameful in terms of marketing Audiences will always receive a few diamonds in the rough though and Barbie is just that Its definitely the most fun Ive had at the movies this year Its a lot more than just bright colours so lets get into it To keep it simple the film follows Barbie Margot Robbie as she realizes there is more to life than just living in Barbie land Accompanied by Ken Ryan Gosling they venture to the real world With many revelations about how awful our world is the two of them discover what is both good and bad about life Im keeping it vague because what helps this simple story become a more complex one is the social commentary and incredibly funny humour I was laughing hysterically throughout and I was genuinely moved by the end Certain viewers may find some of the messages to be heavy handed but I didnt In fact I that the messages actually made the film better overall Yes its a film that explores equal rights but it does so in a fashion that doesnt downgrade anyone but rather puts others on a higher pedestal I really liked how the film handled all of the issues it presented I shouldnt have been too surprised though because Greta Ger wig as a director is just fabulous Having liked both Lady Bird and Little Women Ger wig has continued to impress me as a director even if I have nt exactly loved any of her films yet Well I believe her efforts here made the best film of her career to date There are so many different variations of Ken and Barbie and the performances she pulls out of each and every one of these performers was nothing short of great I mean with that said it didnt hurt that the cast was perfection Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are terrific as always and are obviously the main reason to see this film on the surface but America and S imu Liu were also standouts to me Each character either had a dramatic or comedic moment that stood out and I couldnt get enough of the whole cast Michael Cera as Allen is gold as well but in the end this is a film that all came down to the screenplay Yes the set design is award worthy the musical number is worthy of an Oscar nomination but Greta Ger wig and Noah Baum bach crafted a genius script here The nuances throughout are what sent this film over the edge for me Their attention to detail was perfect here I highly recommend Barbie to all ages and genders out of this Was this in to,9.0,26 July 2023,0.9988

A fun movie with a political agenda my dog just died Barbie is a really fun movie that sets itself up with a lighthearted premise The humor is self aware the set design is immaculate the actors are perfect for their roles But eventually it turns itself into a feminist commentary on the patriarchy This by itself isnt horrible its just quite heavy handed I understand why they did it Barbie as a concept has seen controversy in recent years and it sparked more controversy if they made a movie completely blind to it and not addressing it at all But its just not what you re looking for when you go see a Barbie film In fairness if they went the other route by simply nostalgia bating Im sure people called it hollow money grabbing and meaningless There s no way this movie could ever satisfy everyone Personally I think the movie been better with a tad less social commentary and more focus on the whimsical storyline Other than that no qualms about the execution This is still a really fun movie if you can handle a little political pandering out of this Was this in to,7.0,20 July 2023,0.9159

Not all is peach y when things get preachy eddie It feels like its been some time since a film release has gripped the world quite like the way in which Barbie has over recent weeks months with the Greta Ger wig directed box office sensation creating a global phenomenon that has translated to record breaking openings in cinemas critical plaudits and audience adoration on a scale that is mostly just a dream for Hollywood bigwigs A talent laden affair in front of the camera with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the charge as plastic icons Barbie and Ken respectively and also behind the camera with Ger wig teaming up with her real life partner Noah Baum bach to bring Mate ls beloved creation to life Barbie is far better than it has any right to be as we explore Barbie Land and the real world with our protagonists in what amounts to a pink fever dream that recalls old school Tim Burton at its peak Barbie is also a little too heavy handed in the way in which it hammers home its messaging making the film one that doesnt always correctly balance its oddball charm with preachy messaging A film that in many ways had become too big too fail with anticipation around the one half of Bar ben he i mer with the weighty Oppenheimer no doubt benefiting hugely from the cross promotion reaching fever pitch levels all over the globe the adoration aimed at Ger wigs film right now feels like the type of over the top praise that will be reevaluated in coming months years too something more grounded with Ger wig and her team deserving of praise for creating such a colourful world and giving us something that doesnt just feel like a two hour long toy commercial but also going over the top in its empowerment messaging that feels like a message swung too far into the direction of all men are patriarchal menaces who arent deserving of the women in their lives At its best when it allows its stars a chance to play within the confines of a likeable fish out of water tale where Barbie and Ken roam the boardwalks of Venice Beach adorned in skin tight or where MVP performance as Ken the horse obsessed and Matchbox loving beach bound man child bring too life a range of hilarious situations and sentiments Barbie gets bogged down when it turns its attention to preaching too the converted and fails to make the most of its human characters like America Gloria or Will unnecessary tickle loving CEO for going its comedic charms to try and be something it might naturally have become anyway had it dialled back the politics and just decided to be the fun escapist entertainment it often utilise s When fun and adventure is at the forefront of agenda Ger wigs film is an undeniable delight and you d be hard pressed to recall a more colorful and playful film when Barbie is in full flight but with all the hyperbole coming thick and fast right at this moment in time its hard not too consider public sentiments being blown up out of proportion as the films misses are overlooked in favour of viewers preferring to watch this cultural touchstone with a pair of pink rose tinted glasses Final Say There s fun to be had from Barbie and the commitment of its two leads is a sight to behold as is the world which Ger wig brings to life but when Barbie for goes the fun and playfulness it thrives in in favour of repetitive messaging the film becomes more of a slog than an enjoyment Mojo Dojo Casa out of Jordan and Eddie The Movie Guys out of this Was this in to,6.0,27 July 2023,0.9989

Exactly what it should bel ma brink Barbie was the perfect combination of light weighted fun in Barbie land with greatly timed one liners other clever barbie themed aspects of reality vs the real world and a deep not so hidden meaning behind modern society the patriarchy and feminism There could have been so many things done wrong in this movie that Barbie did right The casting was incredible Even Ryan Gosling who I beforehand thought was too old was great and obviously well chosen for this role Margot Robbie as the literal star of the show was of course explicitly well cast and played barbie like a second skin There is diversity modern issues and a whole lot of fun the whole theater was constantly giggling and laughing I think Barbie is a movie that really shows modern issues in a casual way and would be an eye opener to many people admittedly mostly men on how society views women in day to day life out of this Was this in to,9.0,19 July 2023,0.9816

Wrapped in Plastic Its Fantastic eli copper man After years and years of development and casting changes the live action Barbie movie is finally out for the whole world to see Co written and directed by actor turned filmmaker Greta Ger wig and co produced by and starring Margot Robbie as the titular doll the film has proven to be one of the most anticipated summer blockbusters of and a welcome anniversary present to Warner Bros th year since their inception Now that the film is out for the public and media to enjoy the best way to describe it is a hysterically subversive commentary on feminism disguised as a cheesy fantasy comedy The film follows Stereotypical Barbie and Ken going on a journey of self discovery following an existential crisis all the while encountering people who either want to make or break the dolls spirits Before going into the story itself the ensemble cast must be addressed especially Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the primary Barbie and Ken respectively In addition to sharing witty chemistry with each other the multiple and Kens around Barbie land showcase the blessings of multiple roles for women to take on and a curse in how that can influence the men around them to call the shots Alongside them is America as employee Gloria who has as much to do with existential crisis as she does in trying to repair her distant daughter Sasha stuck in her grumpy teen phase showcasing how different generations operate around the famous Barbie line of toy making Alongside many other well known names like Will Ferrell and Rhea Perlman as two differentiating role models for women around the world the ensemble cast is exactly what will draw butts into seats Now as far as the film itself is concerned the biggest contributing factor to how outlandish it is is that its world building makes no sense at all Barbie land is supposed to be the place where all the and Kens live their lives to the fullest yet the real world is interlinked based on how people have played with them That being said since the film is meant to highlight the conflicting views of feminism in a still patriarchal society the imaginative execution of how the dolls and people interact makes for a lot of eye opening politics centered around how complicated the world truly is While its difficult to say if the film hit all of its targets especially when the politics it tackles are still relevant today its humor and commentary lies in the blending of childhood nostalgia and adult intellectualism This is what partially leads to wanting to leave her perfect paradise and attempts to see Barbie for who he pretends to be Who could have thought a Barbie movie would have reminded us how difficult it is to face having to hide who we truly are out of pressure Of course the production and costume design are what truly stand out around this ambitious feature In contrast to the mundane real world Barbie land is composed of bright colors and make believe dream houses complete with a wide variety of diverse costumes and elaborate sets making up the surreal fantasy landscape As the function through pretend toy logic there are some amusing visual gags based on their imaginary lifestyles and how they appear based on what their owners and did to them in the long run The addition of much cartoon y stunt work makes the film even more hilarious when you realize how little logic is actually in the film depending on the universe Next to Mark and Andrew Wyatt lending their talents to an accompanying score and amusing musical numbers one can sense a true glance of nostalgia with many well known hit songs that contribute to the tone and commercial exploitation Its hard to say if the film is a jukebox musical or not but it certainly is a riot with how much the audience will jive to the beat of the tunes In a day and age where we seem to be forgetting how much fun movies can truly be Greta Ger wigs Barbie is a wonderful reminder as to why its ok to embrace your inner child in a world overrun with societal s and forced maturity Whether or not you ve ever been into the Barbie toy line this film is an absolute must watch for both the casual film goer and fans of hysterical fantasy comedies It is self aware enough to make us laugh at even the smallest of jokes it is mature enough to embrace its own immaturity and it is a reason to still support the hard working crew with how the film industry is going nowadays out of this Was this in to,9.0,24 July 2023,0.9944
Barbie is awesome daniel at a la Lets just get it out of the way I freaking love Barbie So many memories and ideals are connected to her that even without the movie I still get nostalgic about The iconography the looks Ken swoon there was one problem though I am a boy I could never get a Barbie because my parents never would let me have one Instead I stole my cousins mermaid Barbie and treated her like one of my most precious toys until she disappeared perhaps she went into Barbie land Greta Ger wigs movie seemingly let us tap into all of that and more thanks to a great PR team that I have nt seen work their magic since a long long time in other words hype has been BUILT How does it fare I left the cinema with a smile but I wish that it could have something MORE Let me explain down below Barbie is a movie that is about Barbie the doll the idea living in a world separate from reality called Barbie land a world where Barbie is everything from the president to a Nobel prize laureate to a doctor She runs this world in all her iterations until the stereotypical Barbie somehow gets thoughts about death she gets a flat foot CHAOS and she gets s THE HORROR she has to fix this by travelling in the real world with Ken and in this she meets a hard working mother and her cynical daughter fun hi jinks galore This movie has got the aesthetics DOWN like its so pretty and so meticulously done with all the details to how the actors act and how the worlds are built this is more on how the Barbie world is because when it mixes with the real world That s where things get a bit complicated Example There s no actual real separation between Barbie land or the real world meaning that the real world feels like a mirror flipped version of Barbie land where people act just as outlandish as the titular dolls I wish that Greta made a script that actually puts Barbie in real world how it is right now and I know that Greta is great at making reality feel rel a table and recognisable and human but I felt there was not much of a difference Maybe it was so that they could fill the whole company storyline in it Either way I wish that Greta would play more with these contrasts and fish out of water feelings This in turn makes the other characters that should be rel a table for the movie goers i e The daughter and the mother feel painfully flat and just unnecessary for the story overall despite making them deep they felt honestly super flat like dolls and stereotypes of characters in a movie And I dont think that was intention not if you see the movies that she s done before where there s always a singular perspective but here I think she s kind of confused on who to use the perspective the most on Luckily it is Barbie and Ken for the most of the movie Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are doing a fantastic job at playing these characters and its in their moments where the comedy shines the most Another missed opportunity generally I think is just addressing the gay history that is tied to the Barbie brand And how gay men like me were influenced by it not to say that this was absolutely important for a movie like this but I still feel like it made sense at least the gay doll of s Ken who was made popular in the s due to being bought by mostly gay men made an appearance if only briefly I know I shouldnt make demands about this but I feel like there been something even more interesting with addressing all the boys that play with Barbie dolls the real world feels very black and white in this sense But I regress this is just a tangent and a thought I love the comedic and camp elements I think they are what sustain the movie and the fashion of course Also I love that it brings forth the themes of feminism as that is needed in a movie like this I think that it does so in a great manner Is it the movie that I wanted Not really but Im glad that it exists Im glad that I saw it Maybe I was too much swayed by the whole PR marketing strategy but I really wanted this to be a new camp and fun fun classic Instead it feels just good and that s ok I wanted it to be more of an adult oriented movie and maybe that s where Greta kind of flubbed it trying to make it both kid and adult friendly but she honestly doesnt succeed at neither and that s alright out of this Was this in to,7.0,21 July 2023,0.9991
Id probably drop it at around if I watched it alone at home Joy toy xx Attending the pre premiere of the much anticipated Barbie movie was an experience I wont soon forget but unfortunately not for the right reasons At least of the movie was pure hype creating high expectations that were ultimately let down The film seemed primarily aimed at a teenage audience with its trendy aesthetics and themes but it struggled to find its identity It swung between childish and adult ish elements making it challenging to categorize and leaving viewers like me feeling a bit perplexed about its target demographic In the first two thirds of the movie I managed to find a few moments to laugh but my interest began to wane as it entered the final third The lack of a compelling plot and engaging storytelling made it a tedious watch and I myself almost falling asleep in the cinema One of the major letdowns was the extensive marketing that overshadowed the entire experience What made the movie even more uncomfortable for me was the audiences overwhelming obsession with everything pink Nearly of the cinema goers were dressed in various shades of pink and it felt like an extravagant posing session rather than an i movie experience It did not help that movie itself was pretty average it heavily depends on references and superficial jokes which can be amusing on occasion However after being exposed to nearly two hours of such content I was completely brain damaged I wasnt entirely sure what to expect from a Barbie movie but this certainly wasnt it It fell into the same pit as some of live action adaptations that fail to capture the essence of the original material Despite having a few moments of laughter and initial intrigue I wouldnt rate it more than out of If you re looking for a meaningful cinematic experience this film might not be the best choice out of this Was this in to,4.0,20 July 2023,0.8415

A hysterically funny and clever triumph from Ger wig bastille In the hands of another filmmaker a Barbie film could have been a bland or soulless cash grab just seemingly made to sell more of the iconic doll But cine phil es know that Greta Ger wigs short but no less impressive track record of writing and directing is nothing short of superb having made two outstanding films Lady Bird and Little Women Ger wigs films are always rooted in deep emotional affection and a profound understanding of womanhood with a level of emotional authenticity rarely seen in major Hollywood films These levels of depth in her films are complemented by exceptionally clever and often funny writing Needless to say her take on Barbie is exceptional and certainly lives up to the seemingly earth shattering hype Ger wig and Baum bach s satirical screenplay is consistently hilarious from beginning to end while depicting and analyzing themes related to feminism in a thoughtful and profound way The film brilliantly threads the needle between being summer popcorn entertainment and being something far more original creative insightful and clever than simply just that The jokes come rapid fire and are consistently hilarious in an intelligent way even also poking fun at plenty of pop culture and film related references that cine phil es will adore The consistently entertaining and uproarious script is made more impact ful by great performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling who are both absolutely joys to watch as Barbie and Ken respectively The supporting cast is great too with standouts being Kate McKinnon and America Another standout of the film is the superb production design and associated aesthetic qualities of Barbie Land which is absolutely stunning to look at visually While the tone is often comedic which is great given how clever and funny it is its more serious themes are still handled very sensitively including a very powerful monologue from America and an emotionally engaging resolution to the story Sharp incisive original and fun Barbie is an outstanding movie that audiences will remember long after the credits roll and I truly cant wait for Ger wigs next film out of this Was this in to,9.0,23 July 2023,0.9993

This isnt the movie you think it is and its probably better for it I Ail ur Any time a movie prioritizes messaging there s an all too long history of the end result suffering whether in terms of its storytelling its general craftsmanship or both Broadly this trend holds true even when a message is important admirable and agreeable Case in point last years slasher They them was troubled in various ways but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging sure enough the writing suffered in turn This film is not free of that same issue for it is extremely emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey they re terrific ideas but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly indisputably what the script wants to communicate More than that this is a picture that strives to be say and do a lot and in fact it is says and does so much that its a little overwhelming I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus And though I somewhat repeat myself its well worth accentuating that the feature is heavy handed with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves Its a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve and there s no possibility of missing it And yet what s truly amazing is that for all this Barbie is also a movie that is incredibly exceptionally smart I cant readily think of any other title that was so predominantly blunt gawky and straightforward in its presentation but which simultaneously impressed with the absolute supreme intelligence behind everything that s being shoved in our faces Within the slant of being overfull and immoderate its nevertheless remarkably well rounded and balanced Everything it endeavors to be say and do is treated with that same frank hand and all is blended together into a slurry where no facet is allowed to especially outshine the others It bounces from trenchant ly triumphant to awesomely artificial to wildly wacky to dourly dispiriting to honestly heartfelt to satisfying ly sincere and back again but the progression still feels natural and meaningful not to mention purposeful and we never experience whiplash It is entirely unabashed about the values it wields like a flaming sword of vengeance and the themes that serve as its very blood feminism independence denunciation of patriarchy and toxic masculinity self discovery and self realization outside any strict confines or definitions that are forced upon or underhandedly given to us or which we unwittingly construct for ourselves the need to be active agents of our own liberation active defenders of what we wish to build and active stewards of what we wish to maintain and much much more Then too it plainly champions diversity even in just the casting but ultimately acknowledges the advisable place and just importance of diversity and equality in governance and representation touches upon the evils of capitalism and also the multifaceted elements of what signature doll represents for good and for ill recognizes that women who can and should be anything they want can be and may want to be mothers too Its not inaccurate to say that Barbie acts to upholds what are commonly seen as leftist or humanist ideals yet those who decry the feature as part of some subversive agenda either have nt actually seen it or cant discern the immediately transparent notion that values that seek a better more equitable world for everyone can only be said to be dangerous insofar as they threaten those values that work to sustain inequality and injustice Meanwhile setting aside the writing which is so enormously essential to all that this is the film is stupendously well done in every other regard The cast is a blast simply put obviously all having a fantastic time but for as weird and widely varied as the parts and scenes may be everyone also gives excellent performances no less worthy of appreciation than anything else that any of them have done It rather goes without saying that Margot Robbie is altogether luminous as the stereotypical protagonist but I personally am also very happy to see Ne f here so prominently and Kate McKinnon is an outright joy The crew put in magnificent work in every last regard from spellbinding colorful sets to bewitching costume design to impeccable hair and makeup and more Editing cinematography direction sound stunts effects I do not jest when I say that everything here looks fabulous The music is a wonderfully fun garnish that I in no way anticipated and all who contributed to the soundtrack in any way are to be congratulated those instances of choreography that we see are utterly superb providing a level of glee that Id have never supposed even based on advance marketing And as if all the huge concrete ideas behind the screenplay were nt enough the story in and of itself is genuinely entertaining and compelling let alone highly rewarding The scene writing is marvelously strong rich and varied keeping the proceedings fresh and engaging from start to finish the dialogue and characters are as shrewdly penned as anything else in these two hours What here is not brilliant when all is said and done Well I gave my answer when I first s at down but even if its not flawless the imperfections here are less about any discrete weaknesses or shortcomings and more about how stunningly busy the script is stuffed to the proverbial gills and nearly straining to keep itself together even in the face of so much skill and wit And if that s the worst that I can say about a picture then Id say its done darn well for itself indeed The promise of a star studded cast filled with persons I admire and the involvement of an esteemed filmmaker and her partner did nothing to quell skepticism when news first surfaced of a live action Barbie movie on the big screen The first teaser and subsequent trailer elicited much favor but still I had my reservations wondering above all how the same dazzling energy could possibly be sustained for a full length feature Then to be frank there came the swift abrasive reactions from certain people reactions that were laughably alarmist and apoplectic not to mention outlandish and unreasonable Suffice to say that such breath taking reactions were the tipping point for me as they elevated Greta Ger wigs Barbie from a film I might like to check out if I have the chance to a must see And now that I have While all my doubts have been erased and I could hardly be more pleased I can also safely say that this is not the movie I was expecting That riotous energy of the teaser and trailer isnt here for the whole runtime though most of it certainly What we get as complement and in its place though is masterful mindfulness and craftsmanship and a jarring somewhat backhanded but very welcome and refreshing wholehearted sincerity that is all the more smarter for the ways in which sights unseen its kept hidden Ironically I ponder if this isnt too lofty in its writing possibly going over the heads of those who might benefit most from what it has to offer Even if that s true though this is so splendidly well done that it will hold up indefinitely and be something to revisit time and again both for those who want to see what we may have missed before and to ensure that its message reaches the widest possible audience When I was younger Id never have thought a Barbie flick could be this good and substantive but here we are Ger wigs picture is well worth watching and earns my very high hearty

A largely positive message wrapped in a fun package but the execution could have been improved ta Firstly the marketing for Barbie was great The cinema was full of people wearing Pink when I watched Barbie on Friday and Oppenheimer on Saturday Greta Ger wig largely succeeded in creating a fun film that gets her message across although it sometimes became a bit heavy handed at the expense of the narrative and tempo of the Movie Barbie takes on the noble cause of trying to undo the message portrayed by its early history reposition the expectations of females and Barbie dolls and shine a light on the patriarchy which exists in our society Its a movie based on a kids toy but aimed at an older demographic who can internal is e these messages The opening act was fantastic We were introduced to a fantasy Barbie Land which is everything we could have hoped for The set design in immense and filled with predominantly modern day living their dream life in Doll houses Margot Robbie who plays stereotypical Barbie was made for the roll and Ryan Gosling is great as Ken The supporting cast are also a lot of fun In the second act we are given a cause to enter the Real World where we are introduced to Will Ferr all and the Corporation They were the least interesting part of the movie One of the main issue is that they were nt realistic and blurred the lines between the tone of Barbie Land and the real world Whilst some of their jokes were funny a number of them missed something that was true of the movie as a whole We are also introduced to other real world characters who have a bigger role to play In the third act things pick up again as we are able to explore Barbie Land We get an stand off between competing ideologies which is largely entertaining and funny In this act there are a number key moments which reinforce the message of the film followed by several resolutions which may or may not please the general audience There are parts of this act which could have been done better especially when it comes to the overall workings of Barbie Land Barbie teased being a simple movie about a doll and instead went for the bigger goal of being a strong feminist movie and calling out the patriarchy Overall there is a lot of fun to be had with the Barbie movie It aims to deliver a positive message to its core audience however this sometimes comes at the expense of the narrative and tempo of movie as a whole I never imagined that there would be so many thoughts and discussion to have post a Barbie movie If you are caught up in The Barbie hype its worth seeing in the cinema otherwise watch it when it is released to the masses out of this Was this in to,6.0,23 July 2023,0.9982

I fee sorry to those who fell in the Bar ben he i mer trap To say that I was disappointed is an understatement The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie That was kind of fun The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace it tries too hard to be funny The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly It was nowhere close to be in t All movies do a better job at making their point And for me the worst of all is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic Movies should try to unite not divide At least create some discussion rather than being a one way discussion where the writer basically tells everything Parents Not recommended to bring kids it is not for them It can be dull and the jokes are not aimed at that audience Despite all of these problems it deserves points for the first mins of the movie and the aesthetic out of this Was this in to,3.0,20 July 2023,-0.8169
Sex Education with i odin Greta Ger wigs Barbie is perhaps one of the most ambitious film in recent history The fact that a filmmaker decides to make a film on such an idea which is equally popular and problematic is brave It is both a celebration as well as a quip on the Barbie world Barbie deals with the modern day gender issues and how Barbie the company stands as a symbol of all those issues At the same time it cleverly portrays the emotions involved of all those who love and admire this pop symbol Margot Robbie is excellent as Barbie Her performance range is phenomenal Ger wig uses her aptly Gosling is cute and is being judiciously used for his charm and handsome vulnerability that he brings All the supporting casts most of them are from just one show hence the title of this have done their job well Cant say I am particularly impressed by any one though as there isnt much for them to do Although Will l and America are an exception as they shines in their limited appearance and steal the show The music production design and direction along with Baum bach s writing is outrageously entertaining and often funny as well The bizarre world of Barbie will be loved not just by the ones who carry a nostalgic baggage of playing with one in their childhood but also to those who have never ever heard about it Such is the charm of this movie out of this Was this in to,8.0,23 July 2023,0.9758

Gr etta Gere ig Approached j kur n Just want to get this out of the way Greta Ger wig approached and wrote the film Not the other way around This movie is super fun Where this movie shines is the acting production design and soundtrack The script is dense with jokes however it feels like its trying to be too much all at once The big mono l gue was solid though and the subplot with the mother and daughter was emotional and authentic Regardless some people will be of d by or feel left out because for example the trans representation or lack there of It is very binary but the film cant be everything to everyone and I imagine doesnt want to get involved in the culture wars Whether that s an asset or liability is yours to determine Overall its enjoyable but like Christopher Nolan who also has a film competing with it Barbie tries to be too complicated and vague in order to seem clever That being said it hits A LOT on the head I recommend out of this Was this in to,7.0,28 July 2023,0.946
Awkward brilliant anti popcorn movie grinning elvis The most surprising thing about Barbie is that the joke gets old so quickly Then after it stops beating the audience over the head with its obviousness it settles into a self assured groove Its the rare case in which the third act is actually better than the first two The jokes land harder once it sheds the need to be all things at once a twist neatly mirroring the central crisis moment As it plays out the first half of Barbie is surprisingly drab Its a feat of production and winking self reference that threatens to turn into a painful civics lesson and a generic every genre all at once lecture Its not nearly as weird or jarring as it needs to be and ultimately the Barbie world is as lifeless as the titular character But then something interesting happens Barbie actually starts landing some punches Its no accident that a turn happens with the introduction of a fairly obvious twist the introduction of a strange character played by Rhea Perlman And Perlman is the perfect actress to fill such a role She s small un glamorous and crone ish consistently cast as either a venomous tough or as a matronly sieve In Barbie she s a literal chorus and her existence in the film suggests a knowing concession between the Corporate Barbie toy empire and the relationship that so many women have with her and themselves These are the topics that have long churned in Noah Baum bach s films combined with topics that have defined Ger wigs features yet the movie doesnt work like anything the two have accomplished separately Barbie feels like Ladybird by way of The Life Aquatic and when it allows itself to go full blown existential it manages a sort of cinematic brilliance that its rival blockbuster Oppenheimer of Oppenheimer looming so large over everyones attempt at pretension simply cant manage The film has deep flaws but heart is not one of them Its a magical thing to see Margot Robbie cry and while her performance really isnt particularly consequential to the plot it does present emotional heft to a screenplay that is both dullard and brilliant by design Robbie like Theron is a beautiful blonde archetypal actress who just happens to be profoundly intelligent and intense even when the film literally mentions exactly how we are not supposed to look at her as average while begging us to see her as just that Its a neat trick to pull off a genuinely flattering disrobing of stereotypical beauty Its a joke Robbie is in on and a passive exclamation point that co star Ryan Gosling owns I like watching actors having fun I actually never expected to experience this in Barbie especially when it shoehorns in less than interesting roles for Will Farrell and Kate McKinnon and quickly exhausts its post subtlety messaging Farrell and McKinnon are supposed to be two anarchic al characters Both fall flat We ve seen it all before and here they lack any acidity whatsoever Their roles feel tired after countless Toy Story s and Lego Movies treading on the politics of child adult expectations of reality They almost seem like add on s from the corporate execs they lampoon especially troubling in that McKinnon is supposed to represent anarchy But Robbie and America eat up the screen both inhabiting a particular idea that seems to have genuinely spring from Ger wigs best instincts There are scenes that in an overwrought and exaggerated cinematic world seem to actually exist in real life To get caught by surprise seemed impossible as the first act ground to a halt Barbie is a little too blunt for its own good which strangely ends up being a good thing At just under two hours the bludgeoning messaging stops being funny and you feel the fatigue that were supposed to understand is the source of angst In that the ending isnt a reach so much as a confident nod to where Ger wig has taken the audience If its rare to see a actresses having fun in a Hollywood film its especially rare to see a female director genuinely flourishing by being just exactly who she is out of this Was this in to,7.0,27 July 2023,0.9956
Hilarious and Thoughtful talking about movies This is actually very close to a great movie It deserves your time and money at the theatres Remember Lego Movie How no one was expecting anything from it labelling it as a cash grab And it actually turned out to be a thoughtful clever comedy This movie is just as good This is a fun over the top laugh out loud comedy that manages to communicate a very necessary message I loved how much fun it had in doing that It used comedy as a tool to prove its point Its not easy guys Making a satire itself is not easy let alone turning Barbie into a good movie The over the top way this movie made fun of sexism was hilariously genius It reminded me of Dont Look Up That was another movie that deliberately made its characters unrealistically unlike able to prove its point using humour There are dialogues in this movie where I was like its funny but yeah it needed to be said The way this movie constantly made jabs at where gender equality stands at the moment was genius Everyone in this movie is having so much fun The actors all of them gave hilarious performances Ryan Gosling especially was so funny His character was so integral to the main theme of this movie This movie is so self aware that I wouldnt have been surprised if a character just mentioned the opening weekend battle with Oppenheimer It has a few problems though While the way the main theme of this movie is concluded was more or less perfect I thought the way character was concluded didnt make much sense and was sort of contradictory And given that its a very over the top comedy some scenes do stretch a bit too much It can get a bit too preachy at times too But honestly I had a great time I would highly recommend watching this in theatres In fact my entire hall was laughing throughout the movie out of this Was this in to,8.0,22 July 2023,0.9956
Barbie Better than I thought but fell a little short cinema connoisseur Scoreboard Overall Score Storyline Plot Acting Directing Ending Cinematography Comedy Action Overall Review Firstly in all my years of being a Cinema Connoisseur it is rare to see a movie sell out as quickly and widespread as Barbie So well done to the Barbie marketing team I walked in the cinema with no expectations but I have to say I was overall pleasantly surprised with Barbie I thought it might be the usual run of the mill silly kids movie with a completely un serious unrealistic storyline However the Barbie storyline touched on a lot of serious real world issues and situations that many people can relate to With that said it did feel like a senseless musical at times with u ness s ary sing dance scenes The essence of the film touches on the juxtaposition of what life would be like if women ruled the world Barbie Land And the real world we live in which is male dominated This was portrayed well but did get a bit too silly sometimes The level of acting from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were both bang on Considering they were playing dolls they kept a great balance between having to act silly whilst still keeping a level of seriousness so the silly ness doesnt go overboard Overall Barbie was actually a decent watch with a good level of comedy and realism whilst keeping the essence of what Barbie represents Is it worth a watch Whether you are a woman or man young or old Barbie has a little bit for everyone to relate to So for that reason it is worth a watch but dont go in with high hopes unless you are a die hard Barbie fan out of this Was this in to,6.0,22 July 2023,0.9895
Bar ben he i mer Decent comedy handled with a sledgehammer Saw this kind of late on after Oppenheimer As expected the movie looks great Barbie land is a crazy set shot well and all actors are committed Was a bit disappointed with Gosling but could just be the writing direction for him Margot Robbie and America Ferrara shine the most and to a lesser extent Gosling Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell those last two are smaller side characters Some issues with pacing or maybe the movie shorter and the music wasnt all that memorable surprisingly I like more songs or better yet for this whole movie to be a musical My biggest gripe is the writing It is painfully heavy handed preachy and full of cringe This is because the evil patriarchy and righteous feminism is ramp ed up to I honestly kept checking my watch was looking at home with like min left and struggling so hard not to walk out i never do always stay to the end no matter what or fall asleep Maybe it was partly because I had just gotten out of the hr Oppenheimer which I had a strong coffee during but this was one of the toughest movies I had to s it through in a theater in a very long time I think most but still probably not all women will enjoy it but for the fell as Unless you re a self described male feminist or far left politically or maybe just a s imp your mileage is really going to vary and this may not be for you I like Greta Ger wig and the cast but this was a big miss and let down for me Messaging aside I struggle to give this higher than a maybe a at the absolute best wouldnt give it lower than a So Im going with out of this Was this in to,4.0,21 July 2023,0.9492

Barbie its interesting confusing and a lot of fun felipe de souza rosa Barbie is a curious film and I believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average The film tries to criticize several things at the same time criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on self knowledge besides that I assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often its not clear what the movie really wants to be about maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better Anyway the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason I hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on out of this Was this in to,6.0,24 July 2023,0.8043
Gorgeous joseph i rose This movie was incredible it so perfectly portrays the patriarchy and feminist ic ideas It really stood out to me how the worst the Kens had to go through in Barbie land was being ignored and being not very important while the second Barbie went to the real world she was harassed and objectified It ended up STILL being up to Barbie to apologize to Ken at the end of the movie though she did nothing wrong This movie was hilarious and saddening and perfect and it did a fantastic job of showing patriarchal things and balancing the serious and sad with the funny and tender moments I love Great Ger wig and would for sure see this again out of this Was this in to,9.0,26 July 2023,0.9613

The mainstream doll with not such a mainstream film Tom Talks Films I finally plucked up the courage and wore my usual all black clothes as I braved the hordes of pink wearing women to watch Barbie the latest release from director Great Ger wig The film opens with a voice over from Helen telling us how Barbie changed the doll business no longer did young girls just have dolls that were encouraging them to stay in the kitchen now they had barbie who could have any career with the change of an outfit Straight away this should tell you about the gender politics of this film but more on that later We then cut to Barbie land where everything is plastic and fantastic that is until one day Barbie out loud says do you ever think about death Is there not a therapist barbie From there starts an adventure where Barbie and Ken travel to the real world barbie in search of her owner to find the source of her new depressive thoughts and Ken well in search of heart This film is a hard one to unpick as its just chaos there s so much going on all the time so much so that the slower moments act as nice breathers for the audience There s dance sequences action sequences jokes gender politics and somewhere in here there s the typical Barbie plot that you might presume this film would have but its covered with loads of other stuff The thing Im most torn on with this film is that I want to praise Ger wig for creating a Barbie film that no one would have predicted while at the same time I cant help wondering if I personally would have enjoyed it more had it been more generic Im always talking about how films should be more creative and yet this is the question this film has me asking myself Its just different and it definitely isnt a kids film a young girl s at a couple of rows behind me had to keep asking her mum what was going on and I dont blame her as if I was years old I wouldnt have had a clue This film seems to be aimed at women age which is a surprise to me as I thought she was in her late twenties for some reason but you can her actual age if you wish to know Now I know her actual age some of the more older niche references to bands and films etc make more sense and I think its women that are a similar age to her that she s trying to appeal to here That brings me on to the films central the ming which is its gender politics Its a film that s about women and for women and in that it does a great job I think for its target audience it could be an impact ful and empowering piece of art That being said however if you re a pre teen girl or a man you might not get the full emotional impact of this film and I feel that s a bit of a missed opportunity If this film had eased up on the gender politics at times I think it could have appealed to a wider audience and in doing so may have been able to spread the films message further but I think its largely ended up falling on death ears to those who arent in its target audience Its a shame because the film has an important message to share about equality but its one that men need to get onboard with as much as women to bring about any real change By the way for a film that s supposed to be telling women to be who they are and challenge the patriarchy why has a trend been created for women to wear pink to this film considering its one of the most commonly associated colours with women Overall Im not the target audience for this film but I had a good time nonetheless its not one Ill be hurrying back too with haste though out of this Was this in to,6.0,28 July 2023,0.9909

Nothing short of brilliant could be a game changer Stay away from the Metro pol Barbie is an anomaly a force of nature and could potentially be some sort of in ways I cant quite fathom yet I never expected a good Barbie movie to exist especially not one that is so poignant and rich with satire ambition and intellect But this movie isnt just good its fantastic Choosing to make facade one of the primary focuses of the film was probably the most brilliant thing that writer director Greta Ger wig could have done because it allows the movie to function as a wholly progressive and often quite meta experience Though the movie only goes back and forth between Barbie Land and reality I felt as if I traversed through or different dimensions throughout the course of the film The movie has so many layers Im not even sure how Ger wig made it work maybe it was luck maybe it was an incredibly talented cast crew or maybe she s just a genius What s most important is that the movie is hilarious all the way through There were nt many segments where a giant smile was not plastered across my face Though the choices for comedic roles could be perceived as clich e all of them murdered the game with their characters that being Michael Cera as Allan Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie and of course Will Ferrell as the CEO of But its Ryan Gosling that truly steals the show as the funniest part of the entire film Of course its the brilliant writing that allows it but commitment to bringing to life one of the greatest exaggerations of masculinity I have ever seen put to screen is diamond level The way the movie spotlights parallels between straight guy masculinity and gayness as both a joke and an astute observation is incredible and done in a way Ive never seen pulled off before It should be said that what allows a comedy to transcend the bone headed standards that the genre usually plants itself in is a script that actually has something to say from the heart and from the brain I figured it would poke fun at certain gender tropes and politics but I didnt expect Barbie to be full of so much existential philosophy At times it almost felt like Charlie Kaufman LITE but in a GOOD WAY Though most of the film is full of laughs it also has several segments that will suddenly take you to realms of sheer reflection and a surprising amount of emotional resonance I think a lot of people had to get over an am I about to cry at a Barbie movie hump but I want you to know that you should cry at this movie Its both nostalgic and totally ahead of its time at the same time Its actually a very serious and important film underneath all the pink the laughs And on that note its not surprising that so many dudes are already calling it a horrible movie and overly woke feminist propaganda but its definitely lame of them and in my opinion wrong I think a lot of these people are missing a lot of the points and the jokes Though on the surface the movie seems to be poking most fun at men it pokes just as much fun at femininity society and the human experience as a whole It has a lot of critical things to say about all of them Plus if you cant laugh at your own kind especially when its done so articulately with so much love I really think you re doing it all wrong It comes as no surprise that Margot Robbie carries the film wonderfully The soundtrack is also a ton of fun But the most exciting part here as a fan of the cinema is knowing that this is going to take Greta Ger wig to the absolute top of the totem pole She s been such an interesting tasteful and likable multi faceted presence between acting writing and directing and Im very curious and excited to see what she does with her power after this out of this Was this in to,9.0,23 July 2023,0.9979

Barbie Movie does give an Identity to Barbie of mag man ch I want to do the imagining I dont want to be the idea When my kid informed me he and his friends were going to see a Barbie movie I couldnt believe it The stereotypical mother in me instantly responded Seeing as how MI and IJ were running in parallel in theatres I was taken a back and asked him why a group of boys would be interested in seeing Barbie Will there be any girls there Im guessing I probably sounded kind of dorky in his ears His response though was typical of his generation This is a spoof and not a movie aimed at just girls Mom But like any mother I made arrangements to watch the movie myself before he did Also the other reason was that as a kid I had eight dolls and the majority of my time went into playing with them and building stories And only Barbie was one of those dolls whose identity was recognised consistently over the globe Barbie therefore represents the shared imagination of all kids who play with it across the world It was the right decision to see this film because otherwise I would not have realised what a brilliant move it was for the brand to reach out to younger consumers Barbie is a great gimmick for a campaign to appeal to Generation Z which places an emphasis on pragmatics We all know that Barbie has a checkered history version as a math averse doll was not received well Barbie packaged with a dont eat diet handbook protested Someone who seems black on the exterior but is really white on the inside was being mocked by Ore crazy cookie Barbie The creepiest thing was pregnant Barbie with babies in her belly and the oddest thing was when Barbie went through puberty Barbie and Virus Barbie both sparked new debates Parents were largely concerned about the FBI tip of a security threat regarding the Video Girl Barbie Most criticised among Gen Z was excessively slender body which has been an undesirable role model for women It precisely articulates the enormous problem of existential crises that the outside world has manufactured and which individuals have mindlessly embraced To begin with the film explored the same themes including the existential difficulties brought on by the persistence of patriarchy and Barbie stereotypes The story starts with Barbie living a happy life in Barbie land but she notices that she is developing human consciousness To find answers she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality As she and Ken enter the real world Barbie is overwhelmed to see the many ways in which women are treated as objects and devalued Multiple sets of eyes sc rut in is e all of their actions Both Barbie and masculine awakenings also go through existential crises Later in the movie with changed behaviour after going to the real world attempt to appease manly ego by playing a weakling is satire However the much touted gender war is seen humorously despite the fact that it still exists whether people accept it or not Now coming to the technical part of the film the Barbie land segment was overdone The transition from Barbie Land to the actual world was also too long a crisp cut here as in would have made more sense So the movie has a sluggish start but it picks up speed and becomes engaging as time goes on The humour was really clich ed and cheap so that wasnt great Both and performances were excellent While the actors were all spot on the direction let it down by not keeping the action moving at a good clip and by delivering a confusing muddle of a plot and a message that left viewers with no clear conclusions A more succinct conclusion would have been fantastic Though I did like the part at the end where at the workplace Barbie prefers Flat Sandals over heels I was relating all this to my pageant life where wearing a minimum of inches of heels was mandatory before stepping out of your room in public In the movie Barbie leaves the fake world behind To end with my favourite line by creator Ruth Handler played by Rhea Perlman Humans have only one ending Ideas live for ever The movie is a good introduction to the world of dolls for those who have nt seen anything like it before It is a case study in itself showing how the power of sentiment is a driving force in the doll industry After a year of record sales during the epidemic last year saw a dip so its easy to see why is counting on the new Barbie film to reverse the trend by syncing up with generation Z s pragmatic thinking out of this Was this in to,7.0,22 July 2023,0.9937

Great potential but messy closure ramon ver mi j Up to of the storyline the film was great and tapped into essential topics of personal development and gender identities reflecting and criticising society The cast and characters had flair in the right amount of depth and dimensionality as well as chemistry amongst them Also great that by the time the choreographed dancing scene s came in the viewer had gotten the chance to properly care about what had been building up and then the songs had real impact It made for some good fun and laughs As for the remaining it felt the makers did not know how to tie everything up and went for a shallow symbolic move which was very blurry and loose out of this Was this in to,6.0,24 July 2023,0.9793

Lets Go Party With Barbie Stream Big Screen Movie Reviews Welcome back Streamers The most anticipated movie weekend of is here Its Bar ben he i mer If you have nt followed it there s this ridiculous internet debate over which film will reign supreme between Greta Ger wigs Barbie and Christopher Oppenheimer In this corner coming in at inches its the iconic blonde fashion doll Barbie Barbie is the first live action film about the American icon and her place in culture Greta Ger wig and Noah Baum bach wrote a screenplay which Ger wig directs that takes audiences into Barbie land where we meet stereotypical Barbie Maro t Robbie and her fellow living their perfect existences until one day stereotypical Barbie starts to think constantly about death her feet become flat and other things are off Barbie has to make a trek to the real world to find out why things have changed for her and to set them straight Barbie is accompanied by Ken Ryan Gosling whose existence is so dependent upon Barbie that he only has a good day if Barbie looks at him Roller b lading hot pink singing and dancing hi jinks ensue Overall Barbie is a weird and wonderful movie It is clear that a lot of thought and money went into creating this story and world inhabited by Barbie You will be awed by the clever production design and the intense attention to detail that went into constructing Barbie land The colors pop There are cute animated touches throughout Additionally the costume design enhances each Barbie and Ken in interesting ways You ll also notice the music throughout the film is sometimes poignant and sometimes hilarious especially when it involves the Kens From top to bottom the crafts in this movie are top notch and worthy of a trip to the big screen The cast especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are excellent Robbie brings sensitivity and heart to Barbie She s thoughtful and kind while also being naive and troubled by her own existence It is a tricky performance to pull off and Robbie is great Ken is an iconic performance for Gosling He pulls out all of the stops to bring Ken to life I cant imagine another actor being as successful in this role Gosling is a really gifted comedic actor as evidenced by this performance Ill also note that Kate McKinnon American Ferr ar S imu Liu Kingsley Ben A dir Michael Cera and Is s a Rae each have good moments as well Its a big cast but some of the smaller roles do get chances to shine The main issue is that the messaging is so heavy handed There is a lot to unpack about place in society What does she represent to women and girls What does she represent to men There are themes of feminism patriarchy and corporate greed The film does its best to address its issues in a clever and subversive way but it veers into becoming patronizing at times rather than funny and satirical The performances of the actors really carry the film across the finish line despite how it handles its themes Ultimately Barbie is a movie worthy of a trip to the theater It is funny and even clever at times The messaging of the movie gets heavy handed and some of the subversive fun is lost in those moments Nevertheless Gosling and Robbie fully commit to their characters as does the large ensemble and the production design and music are top notch You wont be disappointed with a big box of popcorn You decide if you want to wear hot pink like everyone else out of this Was this in to,8.0,22 July 2023,0.9959
Barbie is catchy fun important and that s it eduardo Greta Ger wig took the most famous doll of humanity a luxury cast and made a good film with an important message Barbie offers almost minutes of fun captivating and fluid moments Mixing real elements with drawn scenarios it manages to bring the two worlds together in a balanced and intelligent way varying between cartoons and the real world It also shows in a very intelligent way all the difficulties that women go through in their lives such as the lack of respect for their intellectual and physical property as well as illustrating a series of moments that illustrate patriarchy and the disrespectful way in which many men treat women and think they are superior based on their gender A message that Ryan Gosling had in a great performance to emphasize the perspective that unfortunately still reigns in many men today Speaking of the cast Ryan Gosling had a script that favored him with several scenes and different roles that allowed him to show all his versatility as an actor and the reality is that he delivered a high level performance the best in the film imo and that he managed not only to give strength to the message that he wanted to convey but also to elevate the film to another level with his musical performances On the other hand imo Margot had a script that didnt exploit all of his acting skills Dont get me wrong her acting is very good within what was provided the performance is very good however I think the script could have given her more due to the versatility she has And my first negative point is precisely that The script was too attached to the message it wanted to convey and did not use all the potential that Barbie provided such as the affective side and its overall positive impact on many women Furthermore the focus on the concept limited the development of characters and a cast that had more to offer The dialogues also suffer from a lot of fluctuations the good dialogues are really good but seem very disconnected from the rest as the construction even them felt lazy Its as if they didnt connect to what just happened in the last few minutes and just came out of nowhere Its a shame because there are really good speeches Finally the message got across clearly and the most important thing is clearly retained This movie was never about pink or a doll It was about women and the rights they are due Respect freedom and justice in relation to the opportunities they should have Doors should open according to the work carried out and the skills demonstrated never to the gender or color of a person Love is love no matters what Respect is to everyone there s no but However I think Greta missed an incredible opportunity to make a stronger statement about equal rights duties and opportunities for all In short its a good film light funny and entertaining and can be watched several times as something to pass the time and have fun but should be watched at least once in a serious and dedicated way for all the message it has out of this Was this in to,6.0,23 July 2023,0.9988

Barbie I took my twin daughters to go see this film at the movie theaters with me this weekend They are and they seemed to enjoy it The film is geared much to a older crowd which helped keep them entertained as well as the adults that were in the theater as well Margot Robbie was great as Barbie she did very good in that role I love how the film put a modern twist on how people are these days in society dealing with social anxiety and other disorders Yet it tells the story of why Barbie was initially invented to began with and what Barbie and Ken stood for This is a good film to watch with your teenage daughters out of this Was this in to,7.0,22 July 2023,0.9722
Spoiler Free Unbiased Review trevor md m Barbie is a film that on the outside appeals to a younger audience but it is certainly much more mature in overall nature Barbie pushes the boundaries of what a people blindly may assume a Barbie movie should or would be able to in both good ways and bad ways The good Barbie is at many moments fun adaptive emotional even philosophically provoking The story is enjoyable and attention grabbing while both Gosling and Robbie have played their roles to a T Margot Robbie played the stereotypical Barbie so well almost too well at times Ryan Gosling played Ken so well and the contrast between him in two different arcs of the film were not only distinct but all believable The costume design was superb and I was thoroughly impressed with some of the visuals and set design throughout The CGI is very poor at a few scenes which normally I would put under cons BUT the film doesnt take its self too seriously during those scenes so its rather comical than anything The bad The writing of this film contains certain elements of contradiction It essentially claims that women can mostly only be powerful by holding high societal job responsibilities such as being a lawyer doctor president etc when this just simply isnt true MOTHERS FOR EXAMPLE Being a mother is one of if not the biggest responsibility a human can have the idea of a collective job that can single handedly shift an entire generations thinking Yeah sorry but mothers are the most powerful The film at several moments gets very political but subliminally and not subliminally which is always annoying no matter what political beliefs you carry its just almost always cringe I guess TL DR Barbie triumphs in being fun engaging and thought provoking The film like many others sells itself short by its political agenda and removes depth by doing so Overall a mostly enjoyable experience meant for an adult audience out of this Was this in to,7.0,23 July 2023,0.9957

Lets go Barbie And Ken is a Ten moh no machado I may not have played with Barbie dolls and fairly no interest in this from a subject standpoint but I have to say this movie rocks Margot Robbie is awesome Ger wigs direction is solid the writing is well thought out the colors pop and lets not forget how amazing Ryan Gosling is in this His Ken will go down in history as one of his best roles calling it now I do wish there were things that were more utilized in the film especially Venice Beach as a location It felt really shoe horned into the plot Also some of the side characters just really didnt need to be there But overall this picture really works because its messaging about the hardships of the modern woman is spot on Also I liked how they actually critiqued at times for making a doll with insane beauty standards for young children Im definitely looking forward to see where Ger wig takes her career after this because this is truly a box office and critical smash that can lead to some interesting projects in the future out of this Was this in to,8.0,25 July 2023,0.985
Barbie is a pretty fun movie to watch and worth the hype As soon as the first teaser trailer dropped on for Barbie it captured my attention and admiration for it recreated the Dawn of Men sequence from Stanley A Space Odyssey in a very creative and classic way The hype of that one minute long clip featuring my celebrity crush Margot Robbie who steals the show no matter what movie or role she is in had me believing that this movie would be phenomenal And over the course of several months until today my expectations for this movie got bigger and bigger This is partly thanks to the Bar ben he i mer online phenomenon which I followed and watched the both movies on the same opening day Honestly I didnt get everything I expected and I cannot say what I got is better than what I had expected However hours of my time in front of that huge screen was pretty fun because Barbie is simply a very fun movie to watch and I absolutely loved it I believe this is thanks to the feeling of watching it on the big screen with a bunch of strangers around to laugh with I will definitely watch the movie again upon the digital release to try to prove myself wrong Margot Robbie is as always phenomenal in the movie Her incredible talent and charm carries almost the entire film not to mention that she is a co producer She is not the best casting choice to play a Barbie doll but in this particular Barbie movie she was born for the role Her co star Ryan Gosling is the comedic heart of the movie Without him the movie would certainly not be as fun as it is The rest of the cast also compliment their roles fairly well playing iconic characters and dolls of different races and sizes I was expecting a longer a more serious and elaborate plot for Barbie but what I got instead is not too bad The movie clearly carries a message and that message is clearly conveyed through a plot that is brief and basically easy to understand which is built up in a favorable way The production design and the costume design is certainly a huge part of the film All the costumes sets props and everything look and feel so compelling and most important of all accurate to the overall history and legacy of Barbie and I hugely respect that attention to detail At the end of the day Barbie is a movie I have been impatiently waiting for a long time and that I feel honored to have seen today on the opening day It is a beautiful work of art paying beautiful homage to the legacy of its origins and I am happy that I started loving this movie way before its release out of this Was this in to,7.0,21 July 2023,0.9985

Pure Escapist chit bai shy a Barbie directed by Greta Ger wig introduces us to Stereotypical Barbie played by Margot Robbie having yet another perfect day in Barbie land an utopia where all its inhabitants are dolls living in their pink dream houses with no exterior walls Each day in Barbie land is a perfect day However one day Barbie shows signs of being a human and is asked to go to Barbie land to figure out who s playing with her and fix everything Along the way she discovers the joys and perils of living amongst humans and where she s truly meant to be In this day and age when a lot of the movies rely on being ultra realistic and dark Barbie comes off as a surprise Its escapism from reality and lots of entertainment is what audiences are craving right now Barbie is such a fun and gorgeous movie that is filled with humour heart emotions and a lot of good messages The production design and costumes are fantastic to look at and are absolute eye candies The story is about self discovery and the evaluation of life however some might be caught off guard with the risks that Greta Ger wig and Noah Baum bach take with thier storytelling and social commentary Speaking of the performances Margot Robbie is perfect as Stereotypical Barbie but its Ryan Ken that shines the most He provides most of the comedic relief and is absolutely hilarious The rest of cast does a pretty good job Plus the monologue given by America is something that everybody should listen to Its so touching and talks about the challenges a woman has to go through in the society Overall Barbie is a vibrant bold and delightful movie that is fuelled by its star studded cast and flawlessly incorporated humour and though some of the creative choices might not always stick the landing the good stuff largely overpowers the bad ones to create an i experience for the audience Greta Ger wig has done it yet again out of this Was this in to,9.0,23 July 2023,0.9967
A fun watch with your partner pedro bh Barbie can offer genuine fun when enjoyed with a partner and a carefree attitude but I strongly advise against watching it in the cinema The movie lacks the expected nostalgia that a Barbie film should evoke and it is riddled with hypocrisy and statements that dont hold true within the storyline At its best the movie is decent The acting over is commendable especially with Margot Robbie delivering a great performance and being a good fit for her role Some scenes are enjoyable and endearing capable of eliciting laughter and providing a good time but they dont leave a lasting impact The soundtrack from my perspective was consistently great throughout the film with just a couple odd choices However my main issue with the movie lies in its overt push of social and political views on to the audience Instead of letting the viewers interpret the themes on their own the film explicitly spells out its messages which can be off putting The movie seems too focused on trying to please every audience resulting in a predictable Hollywood clich Moreover it appears that the film fails to cater to two significant demographics Younger viewers might struggle to follow the movie and comprehend its messages leaving them disconnected and confused On the other hand older audiences who would have been the main target for nostalgic appeal may find this aspect lacking in the film missing an opportunity to connect on a deeper level In summary while Barbie can be enjoyable when approached with the right mindset and company the movie falls short of meeting expectations The strong performances and some fun moments are marred by heavy handed messaging and a failure to deliver the nostalgia that fans were hoping for out of this Was this in to,6.0,23 July 2023,0.9958

Is it really the movie of the summer Im just ken I have many opinions when it comes to this movie The movie itself was great but as everything in life nothing is perfect Why a out of You may ask yourself well even though the movie was great produced had a great casting great costumes and of course an impressive set the plot was weak The fact that Barbie Margot Robbie did not last even five minutes in the Real World disappointed me I know that she was supposed to find Gloria America to get fixed so she could go home and be the stereotypical barbie again which in fact was the main plot of the movie at first However she finds her real fast not giving Barbie enough time to get to know the Real World aside from the disrespectful male individuals in the beginning I would have liked Barbie to experience the Real World in a different way even though the Real World is messed up I think it would have been nice for Barbie to eat an ice cream for the first time that was not made of plastic or simply for Ken to feel the water at the beach and realize it was not made of plastic or foam as well Another thing that I did not like was that some characters from Barbie Dream house were not in the movie such as Ryan Raquel le and Nikki but it was better like that because we all know Raquel le and her unexplainable need to be more successful than barbie at everything Although at some points I wonder what would have been like if Raquel le were in the movie and totally interfered with plan of getting fixed in the Real World Let us talk about Ken Ryan Gosling for a minute I must say that at first I Ryan Gosling unfit for the Ken role but I am completely happy with the way he portrayed his character He made me laugh so much with his facial expressions and his speeches I went to watch the movie for Barbie and ended up in love with character However Ken might have been funny but when he totally invaded house and threw her clothes away I it mean and disrespectful Yet we have never thought about the Kens for a second like where do they go when the go to sleep I feel like they took this movie as a huge propaganda instead of what it should have been A fun movie where Barbie ventures into an un know world for the first time trying to get her problems fixed but having to bear with Ken throughout the whole trip like those comedy movies where a duo must stick together through a difficult situation even though they do not entirely love each personality At last I loved how Barbie did not need a man to be happy or complete and I also loved how Ken realized that he didnt need Barbie for him to be K enough Not like in Dream house where Ken is always so clingy and needy of Barbie just because Like Barbie dont need no man to be Barbie I also loved Allan and his awkwardness so sad that they discontinued him and Midge I would have liked to see Ken and Allan as buddies after all that s why Allan was created to be buddy although I dont think they would have clicked Margot did an amazing job as Barbie and so did Ryan as Ken I love them both and loved their acting in this as well I truly enjoyed the movie expect the little things mentioned previously out of this Was this in to,7.0,24 July 2023,0.9987

Just ok end falls flat je rankin Although the Barbie movies funny bits were good for one viewing and there were several funny bits throughout the film I think the writer director wrote herself into a corner so the ending just falls flat The parodies were funny and the contrasts with real life were funny but the writers just didnt know where to go with the story in the end A lot of Greta Ger wigs films are like that Disappointing I wouldnt see the Barbie movie more than once which is sad because Ive seen Dial of Destiny four times and I am going back for a fifth viewing That film did not disappoint This one could have been a lot better out of this Was this in to,5.0,21 July 2023,0.8354

Barbie delivers plenty of good hilarious fun Hey Harry As the trailer suggests whether you like or dislike Barbie dolls and merchandise there s still plenty of things to enjoy about Greta Ger wigs Barbie Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are brilliantly cast as Barbie and Ken where they both have awesome chemistry and share plenty of hilarious moments on screen I should also add that Gosling delivers what s probably one of the best musical solos of the year next to Jack performance in The Super Mario Bros Movie Barbie is not only an eccentric go of ball comedy but also a thought provoking film with a post feminist take on gender roles and gender stereotypes in current society something highly reminiscent of movies such as The Ugly Truth or Down With Love On that note America powerful monologue near the end of Barbie was on par with Ren e speech in Down With Love While the above description might make it sound like the Barbie movie leans too much into polemics for it to be good escapist fun then dont worry because aside from its core message its still oodles of light hearted hilarious entertainment for everyone to enjoy from beginning to end out of this Was this in to,8.0,27 July 2023,0.9956

There is a substance to this movie jaroslav adam I read from many sources about Barbie being a hardcore feminist movie just as bad as all recent sludge Im happy to report it is not true Barbie and Ken have their separate but equal story arcs Ken goes on adventure of self discovery and ultimately learns his value outside just being there just for Barbie part of the story lingers a lot on the paradox that she is meant to be an icon of emancipation but is also blamed for setting the wrong standards and gets some hate for it There are also real human characters which are compelling at first but rather simplistic The storytelling frequently stops to explore and explain too many messages about society equality misogyny and troubles if growing up and being a woman or a mother The writing has some problems bad jokes and the last twelve minutes are utterly pointless But overall it delivered what it promised in a very nice package The sets and cinematography are top notch as well as the acting out of this Was this in to,6.0,21 July 2023,-0.8189

Unexpected but so enjoyable alex metcalfe This plot of Barbie unexpected I watched it with no real expectations and no other knowledge about what it would be like Barbie took me by surprise at it had a super deep and meaningful plot on being a woman what the barbie life is like vs what it actually is like to be a woman Plus the ken parts were super hilarious the whole cinema was falling out of our seats at Ryan Gosling he played Ken so well And it was great to have these funny moments through out when some of the parts were more serious But I wish it had more barbie references maybe from the movies which is such a memory for me growing up but it seemed to focus more on with jobs trying to show that Girls can grow up to do anything but I guess they couldnt cater to everything as it might ve been to hard to squeeze it all it But other than that this movie was enjoyable maybe not one of my and I might not watch it again but seeing it in the cinema was such a great atmosphere and it was fun to see everyone dress up and have fun and laugh together out of this Was this in to,7.0,22 July 2023,0.9975

Come on Barbie lets go party JE Baez a Barbie may seem like an improbable concept for a thought provoking film but director Greta Ger wig skillfully harnesses this cultural icon to deliver a potent and profound message Ger wig delicately weaves a narrative that explores the complexities of gender dynamics without vilifying either gender demonstrating that Kens in Barbie land face similar challenges as real world women The film also touches on the importance of embracing diversity and dismantling societal barriers The movies production design deserves applause staying true to the beloved Barbie toys while ingeniously utilizing their features to propel the story forward Margot Robbie delivers a phenomenal performance as Barbie injecting depth and nuance into a character often dismissed as one dimensional Ryan Gosling as Ken complements the film with his adept portrayal enhancing the chemistry between the characters while America character brings a layer of rel at ability to the story Ger wigs clever balance of humor and poignancy ensures that the movie achieves its goal of raising awareness without alienating its audience A delightful yet meaningful cinematic experience out of this Was this in to,9.0,21 July 2023,0.991
Bait and Switch Barbie mib Summary This isnt the fun light hearted fantasy the marketing would have you believe It is instead a clunky film that is nearly all social commentary In fact the plot and protagonist of the film is the patriarchy and more specifically men The result is a sexist film that can be good at times but frustrating for many viewers The movie may even be damaging to woman explanation below Full Review I will justify my summary above but I want to first share that the film has a tremendous amount of potential and that I will be looking forward to a sequel should it come out The cast is excellent Gosling absolutely steals the show and is clearly having a ton of fun Robbie is also a gem and is the quintessential Barbie They could not have picked a better cast The set design was fun and probably exactly what you would hope for in a Barbie film The tempo was great the cameos were fun the movie was appropriately self aware the humor generally landed well Its probably not a kids movie and I think that I wouldnt want my kids to attend it do to the adult humor and the social commentary bit I think that for the right audiences the social commentary might elicit some good discussions and may be interesting to some I dont mind social commentary but Id prefer to know that its in the film before I go If I do go see a movie with social commentary its not generally as clunky as the movie Barbie is For example after the movie I asked several people what they thought was the message of the movie and no one person had the same answer Surely the message centers around feminism or womans empowerment These are themes that generally everyone can get behind but the movie isnt clear on specifics Does the movie intend to convey that Barbie is problematic as a doll or symbol Is the movie suggesting the patriarchy is a problem Is it that woman can do anything they put their mind to it Is it saying the diversity is important Basically the movie fails to pinpoint what exactly it is trying to comment on Generally if you go see a movie that is intended to be social commentary then you should come out of it with thought provoking questions and ideas It should be a movie that flips the script so that if you are on the opposite side of an issue you become more aware informed after watching the movie Unfortunately Barbie doesnt do this Barbie lives in a fantasy world but the real world n the film is also a fantasy She doesnt face any real world or realistic dilemma causing us to evaluate the gender systems we have in place Even the times Barbie is subjected to discrimination or sexism which is fairly constant these times are not realistic or believable Thus the commentary comes off as preachy and anecdotal Barbie is also not a role model or a hero in the movie Its weird watching a movie that is written to empower woman while also featuring a weak and sexist female lead The film begins with Barbie dismissing men and being biased towards woman I dont want to leave any spoilers but SEMI SPOILER the movie ends with things being unequal between the sexes As a result the film almost suggests that the sexes shouldnt be treated equally In other words its clear Barbie and Barbie the movie believes females are the superior gender Moreover Barbie is not a strong and powerful woman We are told in the movie that Barbie is an inspiration to woman fairly constantly Normally I would agree But the Barbie in this movie is depicted as un capable and weak She is egocentric and motivated by a desire to be beautiful In fact the entire plot kicks off because she finds on her legs and it later revolves around her self centered interests to maintain power in her community Its hard to relate or feel sympathetic under these circumstances and if anything the plot is an indictment on womans and societies overuse of beauty and sexuality As Barbie trots along her path she doesnt overcome anything on her own and she doesnt change as a person In fact everything she accomplishes is because someone told her what to do or because someone else did something for her Not one time can I recall did Barbie accomplish something on her own or reevaluate her positions By the end of the movie she is still the same problematic Barbie we were first introduced to This is an interesting problem because it means that Ken the movies antagonist is actually the hero of the film He is the only one in the film that overcomes adversity and is the only one in the film who grows and changes We dont root for Ken of course but if you spend a few minutes thinking about his character arch you will realize he is actually the victim and the hero of the movie This is what I meant by saying it is a clunky film it has too many mixed messages unexplored and unrealistic themes and watered down but constant social commentary Then add the fact that the social commentary expressed in the film is of a serious issue but is juxtaposed with a lighthearted comedic tone Then there is the problem with the movies portrayal of men and specifically Ken First lets acknowledge how woman have been poorly portrayed in past by depicting them as weak and needing men We can agree its inappropriate so its confusing as to why the film does the same thing except to men Ken is portrayed as inferior to Barbie in every way when the appropriate thing to do would be highlight the strengths in both genders A counter argument people may make is Dude its just a movie about a doll and its a fantasy land I get it its not real But the problem is the movie depicts men as inferior and stupid in both the fantasy and real world In fact there is little distinction between the men in both worlds On the other hand the woman in the real world are depicted more genuinely and certainly more intelligently This leads me to conclude that the writers likely do have a problem with men even if they were trying to be humorous In fact there is a whole subplot with an all male corporate board that seems to be a non sequitur It seems its only purpose in the film was to dump on men or in the alternative the whole subplot was intended to be something intelligent but ended up being too poorly conceived to be meaningful in any way So I have to say the film is disappointing and problematic in so many ways But the potential is huge I would look forward to a sequel but they have to drop the social commentary or in the alternative make a more cohesive movie with less mixed signals Barbie should demonstrate why she is so amazing and earn her place at the top We dont see why she is special or see her become the hero in her own movie I expected to see a movie about a powerful woman who also likes to have fun What I got instead was a bait and switch out of this Was this

Playful idea about the Barbie concept that gets lost in the messy story movie man Barbie is a new fantasy comedy directed part written and produced by Greta Ger wig director of Lady Bird and Little Women In Barbie land everything is perfect and everything runs smoothly Yet Barbie Margot Robbie learns that something is not right and everything suddenly seems less than perfect for her Because of this she decides to travel to the real world to find out what s going on On this journey she is accompanied by Ken Ryan Gosling who secretly tried to go with her Together they now try to figure out what s going on but learn that the real world is very different compared to Barbie land Greta Ger wig together with the photography director Rodrigo knows how to convey the Barbie world well making it seem as if you are in a life sized dolls room as a viewer They used beautiful film sets for this Thus the film works well as long as it is set in the Barbie land Only that everyone here is Barbie or Ken sometimes makes it a bit difficult to follow the exact differences between all and Kens When the story moves to the real world it changes the movie a bit For example how exactly it is possible to travel between the two worlds is not really clearly explained Furthermore the movie loses credibility when Barbie and Ken can do anything in the real world with no real consequences Due to the lack of explanation and an eye for detail the film can sometimes come across as a bit strange In a comical way they also try to make fun of both gender roles For example Barbie land should represent the opposite of the real world In Barbie land and Kens can do anything but Barbie is often above Ken In the real world men often seem to be above women For example they try to divide this role in the opposite way For male viewers who do not like these current feminism movements this can make this film less Despite multiple actors and actresses playing different and Kens Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling manage to portray their roles in more unique ways alongside the other and Kens cast members Margot Robbie comes across as a real Barbie trying to discover what her life destinies really are Ryan Gosling manages to provide plenty of appropriate comedic moments as Ken who tries to make Barbie notice him In the real world however he learns that as Ken he can also do other things without Barbie Will Ferrell plays the CEO of the toy company that makes the barbie doll His character and the other employees are supposed to be in the real world but they seem more like they re also in a cartoon world because of the ways they act This makes the concept of the real world seem a bit unusual If they brought out the real world a little better the movie could have been a little better The Barbie and Ken concept is better brought to the fore in Toy Story for example where these dolls and the idea they stand for are also handled a bit playfully out of this Was this in to,5.0,23 July 2023,0.9652

Now I am become death destroyer of the patriarchy lucky bucks productions Note I highly recommend seeing both this film and Oppenheimer as a double feature Both are heavy handed films that have characters going through an existential crisis and are consumed with thoughts of death You would think these two films have nothing in common but Im dead serious no pun intended When your film has your narrator saying the word feminism in the first five minutes you know its going to be problematic Now dont get me wrong I have no problem with feminism and I consider myself a feminist Some of my favorite films have feminist characters I knew going in this film was going to be woke I just didnt realize how woke till I saw it which was kind of a disappointment anyway First off dont let the cutesy pink marketing fool you This is not a film for kids but that happens quite a lot in Hollywood For example Drop Dead Fred was a film I saw when I was but it was really for adults But at least it wasnt woke I felt kind of sorry for the little girls I saw wearing their pretty pink outfits and dresses knowing that probably much of the preaching against the patriarchy and lack of genitalia jokes were going to go over their heads Yep I said what I said It only gets worse from there Margot Robbie plays the titular Barbie who lives in Barbie land with all her fellow that can do it all and have it all The Kens are kind of just there The main Ken played by Ryan Gosling gets tired of being from friend zoned and taken for granted by Barbie When Barbie starts to have thoughts of her own mortality has flat feet and she is advised by Kate McKinnon one of the few bright spots in the film as Weird Barbie to go to the Real World to find the girl who s playing with her and make everything right Ken decides to stow away in pink Corvette Both of them discover the Real World is not what it seems My biggest problem with this film was the constant preach in ess especially when Barbie and Ken go to the Real World and it never really stops from there I resented Greta Ger wig for giving the game away There s a way to talk about feminism without hammering it over the head and alienating half your audience in this case men but I doubt many men will see it Its like that South Park episode when Randy makes a musical that explicitly talks about oral sex until he is advised to tone it down and hide the message in subtext That s what Ger wig and her partner Noah Baum bach should have done with the story This is a film that definitely skews toward a female audience It needed to be more subtle with the messaging I would have preferred a fun silly colorful Barbie film rather than having a woke agenda pushed on me Unfortunately that s the direction Hollywood seems to have embraced these days However the visuals were bright fun and colorful along with the hairstyles and wardrobe I liked that they filmed in the Venice Beach Boardwalk and other areas around LA Despite the diversity of the cast my mom was unhappy that she didnt see a Hispanic Barbie and Ken even though we saw a white black and Asian Ken If there were any in the cast I didnt see them America Ferreira and her daughter are indeed Latina but that wasnt enough for her She does have a point though but we could be wrong and missed them Will Ferrell is wasted as the CEO of but I dont care for him anyway so it didnt really matter that I didnt see him much Rhea Perlman did have a nice little part as the creator of Barbie Ruth Handler This film was very strange and I felt kind of alienated by it Plus the last scene of the film was anticlimactic and totally bizarre I get the good intentions by the but it was way too preachy for me Legally Blonde was the closest to a Barbie film up until this point and it was a feminist film that never felt like it was preaching to its audience Elle Woods was a blonde Barbie type character who was underestimated because of her looks but manages to showcase her intelligence and strength as a successful lawyer without the message of the story becoming too heavy handed and retaining the lighthearted playfulness throughout which is what Barbie is missing I think Ill just stick to that film instead out of this Was this in to,5.0,22 July 2023,-0.7242
I mean Bar is really an everything A e S ut thi ph on As someone said this is a bittersweet pill A film that intends to be entertainment and toy marketing but somehow it brought tears out of my eyes I love it I love everything about it I love everything it represents identity crisis toxic masculinity and glorifying the value of dolls Greta Ger wig took an idea that seemed outdated like Barbie to tell a vivid contemporary story At the very same time the film also teases itself and all sorts of pop culture And all the productions oh my they are all very pleasing to my eyes and ears Some that Im stuck on are the half jokes half seriously tone which makes the final act not as powerful as it should be The over explaining of characters when they said everything they thought but didnt really show it in another way and arc are not completely closure to me In the end Billie E il song is the key to winning my heart Man that song and that scene are so beautiful out of this Was this in to,8.0,26 July 2023,0.989
A lot better than I expected Amazing with a bit of a stretched ending t I expected this movie to be a quick predictable cash grab with as much stars as possible for the poster it turned out to be way more It has its flaws but they quickly move past that Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling absolutely killed it It had great social commentary while still being funny and wildly entertaining The design is great from set design to music to choreography Its a feast to see all those stars dancing together and the use of color is amazing The story was well illustrated with showing you the message clearly they sometimes straight up tell you things but those things are well explained in the context The real world part didnt stick to its own rules sometimes it was complete fantasy when it needed to be and sometimes it was supposed to be harsh reality which therefore just didnt work Clich s and tropes were sometimes a bit too much but I didnt really expect something else than that The end conversation was a bit pretentious and a bit weaker than it tried to be for me I could understand that it hit all the right spots for somebody else The jokes were great and I laughed a lot Loved how it looked like the lego movie sometimes Well done Now Im gonna watch Oppenheimer out of this Was this in to,8.0,20 July 2023,0.9939
The most political movie Ive ever seen may aaaaaa a aaaa I loved the effort with the sets and the fun outfits I also really enjoyed the ads threw out movie I was really enjoying this movie but then it started getting really political I was kind of fine with it but then they started making politics the whole story line and so it was really no longer a fun movie After the movie finished I just ended up leaving miserable and like I waist ed money How is a family meant to enjoy this I cant see any year old understanding anything they talk about Also they want to talk about how being a human is hard and that were not perfect but then they hire someone to play a teen girl who has perfect hair and skin A bit of a confusing message out of this Was this in to,2.0,21 July 2023,0.7244

Not better than Oppenheimer but a fun movie Is ak I saw it in a theater the day after I saw Oppenheimer and it was a fun movie I honestly think Margot Robbie is perfect as barbie in this movie Ryan Gosling as Ken is also good I think that because of the movies PG rating the movie doesnt target audience arent kids and there were some violence scenes and Barbie really mentions a lot of death and she has thoughts of dying The movie opened M and I think its going to reach B at the worldwide box office The things I really liked some of the soundtrack The soundtrack features Billie E il ish Ice Spice and Nicki Du a Lip a and so much more singers I also really loved the song Just Ken by Ryan Gosling I also loved the idea of making this movie and the director Greta Ger wig is just a great film director from movies such as Lady Bird and Little Women Some scenes were very boring but I guess its ok I just think that you cant compare this movie to Oppenheimer because Oppenheimer is way better Its a good movie Its still a good movie and my expect out of this Was this in to,8.0,26 July 2023,0.9903
Baffling ly mediocre nw squadron I have been thinking for days and still I have no idea who the target audience for this film is The first half of this movie is not bad at all but once Barbie and Ken leave barbie land the movie just completely falls apart The message shoved in your face way too much and isnt subtle at all characters that are set up early on are completely forgotten by the rd act in a bloated script filled with is sari ly complex feminist ic views For a movie about a childrens toy the dialogue is often much too complex and there s no way in hell a child is going to be able to understand what s going on several lines left me scratching my head as the dialogue is way too overly complex Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are excellent casting choices with Gosling going above and beyond nailing all of the comedic moments and elevating all of the material he was given to work with For a movie I was incredibly excited for I was severely let down and honestly cannot say I recommend this movie to anyone If you are going to only see one blockbuster this summer make it Mission Impossible or Oppenheimer you are not missing out on much here out of this Was this in to,4.0,21 July 2023,0.9245

A thoughtful blockbuster david j ink in s Last year I was appointed to a department hiring committee for an important position When a colleague asked me who else was on the committee she scoffed at the gender composition Even though our department is half women the hiring committee was nearly all men I had nt noticed until she mentioned it What else dont I notice According to the philosopher Richard R or ty art is better at changing minds than argument because it allows the audience to see through someone eyes and empathize In the Barbie movie shortly after he arrives in the real world Ken takes a walk through Century City in Los Angeles Among the skyscrapers there are men in business suits and a guy exiting a gym nods at him A couple of guys jump out of a hummer and policemen ride by on horses A woman assistant is shushed by businessmen in important discussion Finally there is a montage of men US presidents movie stars sports stars stock traders Mount Rushmore and the portraits on US currency Ken realizes that unlike in world men hold the power in the real world Ken learns to sing the Matchbox hit Push featuring the lyrics I want to push your around and I will and I will When the song came out it was my freshman year in high school I must have heard it hundreds of times but I never noticed that the lyrics hinted at violence against the love interest The film made me notice specific parts of American culture which I had absorbed growing up without thinking and which reinforced the idea that men have the power in society The film will work best for an American audience Not only would it had hit less hard if I had nt been forced to reevaluate the messages underlying parts of the culture I grew up with but another wonderful aspect of the film was its send ups of American films and popular music The opening to is ported into the wonderful first minutes of the film A bit later a character makes Barbie choose between continuing her fantasy life represented by a still e to and learning the truth a birk en stock There is a great musical tribute to Take on Me I know a ha is Norwegian but it was a US hit and a power ballad that reminded me of Free Bird Later in the film Ken wears a faux mink coat that Im sure Ive seen on Logan Paul I must have missed many more It is surprising that signed off on the film since it does a good job of presenting the good the bad and the weird of Barbie over the years While she started out in a swimsuit were sold in the getup of just about every profession Girls could play with Barbie the surgeon Barbie the scientist or Barbie the politician and maybe imagine themselves in those traditionally male roles On the other hand a teenage character points out that Barbie has given unrealistic body and beauty ideals to generations of women and that Barbie promotes unhealthy consumer culture with all of her outfits and accessories If nothing else the color profile of Barbie is pink and glittery The weird are all the discontinued including Growing Up Skipper a doll with inflatable breasts I nicked one star because of the constant product placement and the milquetoast feel good ending That said the movie is worth your time After years of copy paste superhero movies and CGI spectacles the Barbie movie gives me hope for a future of more thoughtful Hollywood blockbusters out of this Was this in to,9.0,23 July 2023,0.9975

Even non Barbie fans can enjoy this kj c I am not a huge Barbie fan I want to say that right out of the gate My mom however has a massive collection She was at just the right age when the dolls came out that Barbie was a huge part of her life Knowing that I took her to see Barbie yesterday morning Parents of young children there s nothing inappropriate going on but you may want to wait on this one While its visually stunning I wouldnt call it a kids movie There are lots of complex themes woven into it that younger kids may not understand Production design is stellar In scenes where some of the in famous Barbie dream house is involved the props behave just like Barbie toys do Its a subtle reminder that the team understood the assignment did not disappoint The costume design is also amazing There are joking references to costumes that were discontinued that fans of the toy line will enjoy The end credits also do a great job of referencing deep cuts in the Barbie lineup Diversity is on full display here it works to the advantage Girls women watching this film will find a Barbie that looks like them And gents they didnt forget you either There are also diverse Kens in Barbie land In fact Im going to have trouble watching Kingsley Ben A dir in Secret Invasion as Grav ik because he makes a great Ken The whole point is representation Barbie can be anything The movie does a great job of driving that home The marketing mentioned if you loved Barbie or hated Barbie this is the movie for you It doesnt shy away from detractors daughter delivers a scathing referendum on impact on society But later on Gloria delivers a monologue that had my whole theater cheering when she finished As a middle aged woman I related to everything she said I didnt find it preachy as some have said It felt heartfelt reflective of what most women deal with every single day Its fun At times its plain old goofy The dance numbers are on point I dont know what I was expecting but I walked out of the theater still chuckling Its okay to revel in the fun of it Its okay to dive into the deeper themes There were tons of Kens in my theater wearing their favorite shade of pink be it subtle or neon The fans are all in even a reluctant movie goer like me can get on board Lots of laughs with enough real world to make it rel a table One of the better movies Ive seen in a very long time No post credits sequences out of this Was this in to,9.0,23 July 2023,0.9981
A Satire On Human Species and A Tale of Time andrej mic ic The Barbie movie had a very easy going start with parties colors and making fun of stereotypes Its all very musical like until l Barbie asks the question about dying which can be seen in trailer The movie slowly starts to take itself more seriously and when Barbie goes to the Real World she faces problems that modern woman has Ken also has to face the Real World but does it in his own way It was very cool seeing two characters detached from reality and having completely different view on the world face the reality and carry themselves with it It makes the characters more fleshed out which the movie does well as ive got a feeling that Barbie and Ken in particular are behaving just how they were imagined to since they were first made Time and Change are factors that are actually displayed through small cameos and at the ending itself but have a very important meaning and are factors that should be thought about after you watch the movie Ultimately the agenda goes from funny jokes to actual rants towards the end of the movie but it all comes a full circle and sends a strong message The music and cinematography are very and nice so is the dialogue The references to other media are very cleverly put throughout the movie as well The dialogue at the beginning is made to look like kids actually playing with those dolls but facing the reality is actually a very good space for character development and Barbie used that very good Even tho some agendas are pushed throughout the movie it ultimately sends a good message and does what Barbie is supposed to do to inspire girls and make them feel strong for who they are out of this Was this in to,8.0,19 July 2023,0.9962

mixed bags jo I this to be a mixed bag First up when I walked into the cinema I expected there to be lots of young Barbie fans there were nt more than a handful The audience was a real cross section Probably the majority were females just People of all ages from a few young girls through to pensioners with lots in the teen eager to late group Lots of people wearing pink This is the first time I can remember since Terminator where I couldnt go to the screening time I wanted as it was sold out for my two first choices in the day time I was expecting a high camp movie that works on both levels young kids and something for the adults That s not really what we got This is not a kids movie The group of kids s at near us were visibly bored after the first half an hour Its a A for a reason There seems to be a perception that this movie is for little girls waving around it isnt The first half hour has all the camp stuff setting the scene adults acting as dolls funny Barbie world isms etc Then it changes when America and her joy sucking teenage daughter are introduced It stops being so much fun The central message of the film is then clumsily hammered home with no subtlety for the rest of the movie taking the viewer out of Barbie world Its message is also delivered inconsistently The final joke of the movie does not hit home very well and seemed a bit unnecessary With the above criticisms here s the mixed bag bit it was very funny in places We laughed out loud lots but seemed to be the only people in the full theatre laughing Its also very clever in places like the discontinued Ryan Gosling is excellent Will Ferrell is hilarious Michael Cera is good Others are confusing Rhea character I expected more from N cut i Ga twa given he is the new Dr Who Some very amusing musical numbers It felt a little long Would have made a nice minute movie out of this Was this in to,5.0,24 July 2023,0.9893

Surprised but not disappointed loi c janssen I went into this movie thinking it would be a mature twist on the classical Barbie figure and the ideal life of Barbie Ken as Barbie related content is usually known for I was however quite surprised with the depth of the themes in this movie The themes of gender equality and femininity were touched on in a very observant and interesting fashion not necessarily pushing any agenda but instead giving the viewer their own opportunity to make their mind up and think a bit Despite the us themes the movie is very funny and gives a lot of big and small nudges to the Barbie franchise and history Its remarkably weird at times but in a good way The acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is great as well as by a lot of the side characters The set designs are also amazingly done and give the movie a nice feel The audience was very hyped up and clapped or screamed on multiple occasions improving the cinema experience on our visit at the opening night as well Would definitely recommend a cinema viewing out of this Was this in to,8.0,19 July 2023,0.9952

Could have been feminist ic in a good way sarah s oder strom With all the hype around this film my expectations were high and were initially met The film begins as a self aware lighthearted critique of its own legacy but as Barbie steps her flattened foot into the real world transcends into a clumsy story on gender inequalities Whilst funny and original at first it doesnt take long to notice the repetition of the same jokes that were introduced in the initial minutes of the script as the film transitions into a full blown battle of the sexes Despite these flaws the casting is well executed with Ryan Gosling delivering a brilliant performance as Ken Unfortunately even his portrayal is unable to compensate for the deficient plot out of this Was this in to,5.0,19 July 2023,0.926

Exceeded my expectations leonardo cedi I just saw the barbie movie this day and in a few words I can say that it exceeded my expectations that I had about this movie First of all the performance of all the characters in general is more than decent and I also feel that it had a perfectly planned plot since I consider that no scene is out of context or just filler which is something that happens very often in movies these days Also another aspect to highlight is that the film in general is still entertaining for audiences of all ages since it contains humorous phrases and references that make the film more attractive to people Finally the main reason why I liked this film so much was that it leaves you with a very deep message since this film touches on very sensitive issues that represent the defects of the human being and this film leaves us a message that we are all equally important and that we must not let ourselves be carried away by society s stereotypes out of this Was this in to,8.0,22 July 2023,0.9324
Fun and heartwarming q hy t When I first walked into the cinema to watch this movie my first expectation is just for it to be funny and fun pink stuff but I expected a more deeper meaning to this movie when its a Greta Ger wig movie And what even more interesting about this movie is when you watch this at the first half you would think it is solely about woman empowerment and stuff but at the end it really does explain about mans feeling and insecurities as well The introduction of patriarchy towards Ken is such an amazing and fun scene to watch Ryan gosling is such a good actor to play the him bo role since you can enjoy his character despite how he portrayed the toxic masculinity role so well But I wanna focus more on my point of view as a woman myself here Watching this movie as someone who s childhood revolves around Barbie doll brings so much nostalgia and make me realize how it plays a huge part in my journey as a woman The transitions from being a little girl to a woman is spot on It touches about insecurities and the mans expectations of a woman and many more crucial problems It is so woman empowering and the message is quite obvious and delivered pretty strongly and straight forward in the scripts But I couldnt deny the script writing really touches my heart and makes me wanna cry But i still wish it was being pot rayed and conveyed more subtly as it will be more fun for viewers to interpret the message itself but I understand that this Barbie movies targeted audience could be from all range of age so the message should be crystal clear Its just some people might think that this movie is solely forcing an agenda Like as a woman I get this whole messages but for someone else it might be coming off to strong and seems pretty stereotypical feminism BS which is a hard pill to swallow but we all know certain people in our society will have that kind of opinion when they saw the movie That s why I wish it comes more naturally that s all But I think the ending make up the whole strong message about feminism earlier with how its was not just about that Like I said the movie also touches about the whole experience as a human no matter what their gender are and how were flawed but that s just what life is out of this Was this in to,9.0,21 July 2023,0.9972

Fun but occasionally confused with itself to mp mcr Ill start with the issues because overall this movie was enjoyable if you dont take it too seriously The majority of the movie is a lighthearted comedy The biggest tool a comedy has to use for conveying societal criticisms is satire The beauty of satire is that you can make some really good points When the movie used satire to make its points it was great But the of the time that it forgot about the comedy altogether and tried to take itself too seriously Im not saying the subject itself matter wasnt serious conflicted with its own tone You can make all the points you want to make with a biting satire without stomping on your own tone The ending for Barbie was felt misguided Without spoiling it there s a point between when the final conflict is resolved and the very last scene of the movie where barbie experiences something It looks like the scene is supposed to be deep and insightful but it honestly felt like the writers got to that point in the movie and didnt know how to end it so they just piled on some abstract feelings and vague phrases for a transition Sort of like a high schooler writing an essay and not knowing how to write a concluding paragraph The middle school girl character is a dimensional character but writing young children characters seems to be a challenge for Hollywood so you cant blame them too much And lastly the whole car chase scene was a blatant Chevy ad to the point that it was almost funny itself Now the good The visuals and characters were all done really well and not just Robbie and Reynolds but the rest of the cast The movie itself was really entertaining and worth a watch out of this Was this in to,8.0,23 July 2023,0.9958

A Invigorating Exploration into the Human Condition nicole After watching the trailers promotional materials and interviews I had very high hopes for this film especially when looking at other work I was not disappointed I went to see it at the cinema with my partner the first weekend of its release and before I had even s at in my seat I was already impressed Over half the audience were families with young children dressed up and holding their own barbie dolls The rest were couples older people groups of young lads and friends The majority of the audience were sporting pink and there was a real buzz of excited chatter in the air that I can not recall ever experiencing to this extent before a film I think this is a testament to the entire creative team to manage to produce so much excitement among so many different types of people is a feat I have not personally witnessed accomplished in my entire adult life The opening scenes were outstanding The introduction to barbie struck me on an emotional level and perfectly set up the characters of the film The introduction to Barbie left me reminiscing of my own childhood experiences of playing with the dolls and managed to perfectly capture the excitement that was to come I really enjoyed how some things were left unsaid and your imagination had to do the groundwork In a film made to appeal to both children and adults often most aspects are over explained and nothing is left up to interpretation yet Barbie managed to ask questions it did not provide complete answers for whilst still maintaining accessibility for its entire audience It had some really imaginative sequences and routines that ensured the film had constant sparkle The choreography and set design complimented these aspects beautifully There were really touching moments on humanity feminism society and relationships without villain i zing Ken Men which would have been an easy cop out It was also oozing with comedic value Robbie and Reynolds were hilarious and brought a youthful exuberance to their respective roles None of the jokes fell flat and there were many moments where I was laughing out loud in the cinema I will say that the casting of the mother and daughter did not feel as strong and that there were some scenes of product placement that felt really forced and did briefly take me out the film Additionally I felt the film did not really know how to finish its story and the last minuets were weak compared to the rest of the movie Despite these criticisms I absolutely adored the film A more honest reflection would probably lead me to score it however personally the relationship I had with in my own childhood strengthened my appreciation for the film It was funny touching exciting all whilst being really quite sad I laughed and I cried I would recommend this film to anyone as I feel that all people going to see it with an open mind will find that they authentically enjoy it Thank you Greta for taking me back to my own childhood and capturing those big questions that begin in our youth on the big screen out of this Was this in to,9.0,23 July 2023,0.998

Mature humour mixed with absolutely beautiful scenes Unusual Km c Barbie lives in a perfect world When she discovers the real world she realises that people age have depression family issues and do not see the world as a perfect place that they want to be in everyday This theme of Barbie coming to terms with what it means to be a human with both the lows and the highs is what leads to some truly beautiful scenes that make the room freeze I saw the movie in a packed venue a couple hundred people all munching crisps and children rustling and asking questions During these scenes everything was silent No one moved ate or talked As for the rest of the movie it was great If you re just looking for a good movie this is one Plenty of humour and the soundtrack is amazing an instant save on Spot if y The dance sequences especially the ones with Ken are a feast for the eyes The movie touches on the idea that you dont have to be perfect or the best You dont have to be a lawyer doctor or a celebrity or a nobel prize winner There is nothing worn g with just being average The only thing stopping me from rating higher is a personal itch with the movie the main part of the movie is Barbie dealing with a male dominated society patriarchy and all the issues women face in that I dont mind the concept but after the movie I wished that wasnt the main focus It would have been a masterpiece of a movie if it had focused on the problems of the human soul sadness loss regret and the joys of human life raising a child friends finding happiness in the worst places instead of boys vs girls Lastly I would recommend a word of caution for any parents taking children to see it it is rated a at least in the UK and that s solely due to the sexual undertones and jokes thrown around Nothing terrible but could be slightly uncomfortable The hype surrounding the movie paid off Im glad I watched it out of this Was this in to,8.0,22 July 2023,0.9907
It isnt for everyone but it is for me alexandra gar n ham It definitely lived up to my expectations Walking into the theater I was scared Considering all the amazing marketing and promotion for this movie it been easily disappointing but it wasnt for me The acting was amazing the jokes and dialogue were funny but most importantly it had a message and they stick to it throughout the movie I dont think the world is ready for a film centered around women maybe its too soon I think some men will wrongly assume that it is an anti men movie and they will hate it for it Its far from that My hope is that with time people will understand its message and realize that were all K enough out of this Was this in to,9.0,22 July 2023,0.9568

Pure Fun kevin tine Barbie is a movie about Barbie having an existential crisis Yeah that s actually the movie And its GREAT All the in barbie land believe that they helped woman and young girls be whatever they want to be and empowered them but Margot Barbie finds out that s not true she completely looses it Margot Robbie is fantastic and both sides of the spectrum the stereotypical Barbie and portraying the existential crisis she is one But at this point what cant Margot Robbie do she s fantastic Ryan Gosling is the real MVP he puts in a performance of a life time The Ken off Ken War War of Whatever That whole sequence is amazing from the song to the choreography Ryan Goslings comedic timing is impeccable and I love the journey he embarks in and his ending to finding out he doesnt live for Barbie he is his own Ken The production design is absolutely fantastic every single detail is looked after the costumes are beautiful everything in Barbie land is so colourful and so pretty to look at There comes a disconnect when they reach the real world that is a necessary evil I say that because I didnt like many of the sequences there but I thought every was necessary for the rest of the movie to work Not every joke lands but that s what happens when you take risks the movie is hilarious nonetheless Its a fantastic time and my only regret is that I didnt find a pink shirt to wear to the movie out of this Was this in to,8.0,21 July 2023,0.9517

Not even Plastic tc james This film is filled with cheap cinematic and comedic tricks dying for attention and relevance In the end the moments are stale and require as sense of I guess I should laugh or chuckle a little poor things The film preys solely upon the desperate desire permeating American culture for something anything please Nope still dont have anything original or high quality in this Era of film making Most sequences of the film are a collection of unbelievable gram like moments strung together with a lazy unity that affirms one thing confusion This film grossly underestimates the IQ of its audience or lacks the subtly and nuance to pursue the complex arguments regarding its central political themes It says only so much afraid at every step to be cancelled but also trying to stand firm in some desperation for truth to help stand up to that mean The same that Warner Bros who produced the Barbie film is partnered with Margot Robbie tries to give it her all she can open one eye tear stream with the best of them but her performance lacks the quiet composure of all struggling with identity issues It is surely a barbie ri fic film Although even the fake smiles of the actors seem fake almost as if they are saying I cant believe I am doing this They almost solemnly predict the end of the film before a single ounce of real joy can be seen had The entire film is depressing even where it is supposed to be joyful There is no great sense of play It appears everyone is outstandingly self conscious and hyper aware Weirdly hyper aware These arent artists with perhaps the exception of Gosling These are everyday men and women pretending to be actors and absurdly conscious of it One can only get along with color palettes explosions and circus jokes provocative one liners for so long The real attempt at story was shaky at best Amazingly studios allow Ger wig to direct a high school film project with a million dollar budget and a volunteer casting call of beginning drama students and a few pretty people who always wanted to be in a movie The long wait gets longer When will art take a step forward We have an American culture of business people all greedy for more money money money very well we lack artists out of this Was this in to,2.0,25 July 2023,0.9841

Surprisingly goody a a n As a teenager I just went to this movie because of all the hype and jokes on gram etc But surprisingly this movie was actually really good Un surprisingly Margot Robbie was phenomenal and was the PERFECT choice for Barbie When the movie first started I really didnt know what it was going to be I thought it would just be a girly movie about dolls and feminists and everything wrong with Hollywood nowadays but this quickly proved otherwise It had the perfect amount of jokes which were surprisingly funny the plot was simple but entertaining Toward the end of the movie it got really serious and it really had me thinking about life in a way where I just want to get my life together and be a better person In conclusion this movie was great and Greta Ger wig did an amazing job with the cast and the movie as a whole out of this Was this in to,9.0,21 July 2023,0.9937

One of the best movies Ive seen in years jaime e matheson I expected this to be a very good movie with some feminist undertones It ended up being insanely funny ridiculous fun and stupidly entertaining yet highly topical and comment at ive This movie hit on so many topics patriarchy capitalism feminism even mis an dry yet managed to stay consistently funny and wild throughout It never goes where you expect it to go but always defies expectations The only reason I dont give this a is for the small section of time where the feminism appears a bit too heavy handed and I can see where that would cause some male viewers to lose interest in the message Other than that this is the best movie Ive seen in years and I cant see any topping it any time soon out of this Was this in to,9.0,23 July 2023,0.9348

Great satire on present day society s a a Gets you a typical Hollywood movie which feels good to watch but provokes you to think it helps you decide whether you want to be just influenced by the world around you the media the news and the industry which is grabbing your attention or do you want to accept that you are a human being with needs and wants and not just a piece of toy to be manipulated by the media It begins with a simile of life that is Barbie land it is kind of our own sweet world which every human being prefers to live into rather than entering into the race of humans into the workforce and do the society etc and their Barbie and can reflect upon how different the real world can be from the world they re used to kind of like what happens to people of every kind I think this is a super movie too provoking people to think are they living to please the world around them or are they just living to live out of this Was this in to,9.0,26 July 2023,0.9626

Barbie is the worst and most evil b Barbie is supposed to be happy peppy but here she and her world is the complete opposite She might smile and there might be bright colours but underneath this is dark very dark This is also strangely adult with plenty of adult humour Barbie is usually also about empowerment and be who you are sort of a thing but that is not what this is about Not at all This movie is made out of pure seething hate hatred of all that is good proper and real This might be the darkest most evil movie I have seen We watched this just after Oppenheimer because we wanted to make a full day out of it and watch both movies And we all know that Oppenheimer is not the happiest movie with a pretty heavy subject matter but this Barbie movie is far far worse Imagine that A couple of nuclear bombs killing hundreds of thousands and Barbie is still worse The positives is that there was a couple of jokes that landed but only felt weird laughing at anything in this movie And there were a couple of cute moments but those only felt forced in there and felt like a shadow of what is really going on The movie is also fairly competently made so I cannot really fault cinematography too much although there is plenty to complain about there too I would strongly suggest that you never ever take your kids to see this movie Hide it from them And to anyone who wants to see this I suggest you put on a tinfoil hat and drink a lot because there are some competence behind making the movie b out of this Was this in to,2.0,22 July 2023,-0.9467

justice for ken black helmet man Okay I thoroughly enjoyed this movie Its funny its charming and also manages to make you cry It reminds me of the kind of movie that becomes a cult classic years later like Napoleon Dynamite or Drop Dead Gorgeous Its definitely not for everyone but in my opinion the wacky bounce between spoof and serious makes it wildly entertaining This isnt a movie to take seriously but it is definitely thought provoking Its take on feminism and the patriarchy is displayed in a way that is almost making fun of itself And I think that s nice because the movie displays a message that everyone should be equal living a life in a patriarchal society isnt great but neither is one designed for women Like The Importance of Being Earnest it nods to the problems of the world in a comedic way making it easier to digest My only annoyance about this film is a bit of a spoiler so read no more if you dont want to be spoiled I definitely recommend watching this movie btw Ken was bashed in this movie He was treated like garbage and it makes me sad The poor guy didnt know how to be happy without Barbie liking him The guy needs a hug and a better girlfriend Cause Barbie was kind of a jerk to him in this movie It irked me because no one would like that aspect if the roles were reversed Anyway watch this movie if you want to be entertained by a wacky plot and great underlying message out of this Was this in to,8.0,22 July 2023,0.9846

Disappointingly awesome film vlad len f Had another look at the Barbie film The first impression is undoubtedly a great colourful story of Barbie finding herself in the world But if you watch it again more thoughtfully opening your heart and mind Im afraid you will leave the cinema devastated and crushed I wont retell the plot but it hides a horrifying reality of the modern world that even the authors didnt have in mind The film Barbie was supposed to be an ode to liberal feminism but I saw a different reality character is not at all central to the story The film is not about her The film shows the dismal state of men in a society where everything revolves around vaginas Im not saying that its from the film There the film ends with that literally a vagina But that s not my point The authors without realising it themselves bring dramatic story to the forefront Its Ken who wants to change for the better not silly Barbie Its Ken who literally changes his life through his quest to find himself in the world This is Ken overcoming himself Its Ken who is talented resourceful and driven And what does Barbie do She s like a capricious girl who just goes with the flow She doesnt want change She s satisfied with the monotonous course of her life chatting with everyone and partying in the evening Unfortunately Ken in love with Barbie does not fit in with her meaningless existence in any way Ken ends up building his own amusement park with blackjack and hookers Everything was great there everyone was happy there everyone was happy until Barbie came along and through blatant treachery broke it again Ken very accurately said then that in this world unfortunately there is only Barbie and next to her Ken there is no just Ken Just happy Ken He was trapped in the idiotic world of vaginas A world where its proclaimed that all men are fools and women are goddesses reflexive about every fucking thing Gotta hand it to the makers musical episode is the best thing Ive ever seen on film lately Definitely on the list of best films of the year Disappointingly awesome film out of this Was this in to,9.0,24 July 2023,0.9802

Barbie Beautiful Bold and Somewhat Brilliant there is only matthew man Greta Ger wig continues to prove herself as a leading filmmaker in industry In what is one half of the Bar ben he i mer experience many would be quick to assume that given the subject matter Oppenheimer is the superior film that makes you think while Barbie is the film where you turn your brain off and enjoy the silliness And while the movie is undeniably silly it proves throughout its runtime that its something more Barbie is beautiful bold and somewhat brilliant The beauty of Barbie lies in the sheer talent of its cast Margot Robbie shines yet again giving it her all in the titular role By playing the stereotypical Barbie she lives in Barbie land and enjoys time with her friends in her dream house and on the beach But through certain cracks in her perfect world that lead to an existential crisis Barbie is forced to change and go through her Journey Margot Robbie plays this role beautifully showing the contrast between the Barbie who has a perfect life and the Barbie who learns what life is all about She may not get any awards or nominations but Margot Robbie is deserving of recognition once again This film is bold and that quality is personified in none other than Ken played wonderfully by Ryan Gosling Throughout this story you get the sense that Ken is just another trivial member of Barbie land only existing as a secondary accessory to Barbie When he joins Barbie on her journey Ken is focused on helping because he wants Barbie to succeed This changes once the pair enter the human world Ken learns about the patriarchy and realizes he wants something more for himself Ryan Gosling is a true scene stealer and should get award consideration Gosling is fun goofy and shows off his dancing and singing skills displayed in past films But when Ken learns of the value of men he finally feels accepted and important when all he knew was to serve someone story Gosling portrays this magnificently another reason for success However while the film brilliantly explores themes of purpose and identity it falls flat in its delivery of a message regarding feminism and the patriarchy Throughout the film Barbie is described as a concept for all girls to look up to The patriarchy and its negative impact is mentioned ad nausea m causing some eye rolling reactions from me But Sasha Ariana Green blatt who starts off a harsh critic of Barbie explains the irony in the Barbie doll Barbie is supposed to be the girl to look up to but historically the doll is just capitalism and consumerism at its finest And while its important to show the power of having women in charge and the dangers of the patriarchy the message is so blunt and preached to the audience unlike the other important themes Barbie is a wonderful viewing experience with the bright colors go of in ess and dance numbers you d expect and the emotional heft that ll stick with you Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are worthy leads but the rest of the cast deserves recognition for putting their all in the role they were given The movie is powerful but there are times when it slips and preaches to us rather than showing us Overall a great time and if you truly want to maximize your experience a Barbie chaser to the Oppenheimer feast is perfection out of this Was this in to,8.0,22 July 2023,0.9988

An comment about feminism men gender equality hans ch solo An film that tries to balance out humor and leaving social criticism in the minds of the viewers Barbie falls flat with its criticism not only because it feels flat and out of place but most importantly unnatural and unimportant Why does a film about a female toy that kids play with need to comment on feminism The use of feminism is to give a woman the right to choose for themselves and to be what they want for example no woman nowadays should be a housewife if they do not want it to be There are still current problems such as loans the pay gap shouldnt be a thing that is where gender equality is important but Barbie gets it wrong and simply criticizes the mental state of being a woman and having it hard in its own life and still try to cover it up and being controlled by men While I know that this is a problem in some cultures and countries it is not the ones that people watch this film in And Barbie definitely doesnt means it in that way Ken plays the stereotypical men he wants to rule and fulfill himself in his life and he searches for meaning His character development ends with him needing to let go of Barbie to truly find himself and Barbie says that he wasnt created only to be boyfriend but truly he was No one bought a ken toy without a Barbie toy so why cant we let the toys that girls play with be toys they play with Barbie sees the Real world as an issue because she thinks it only gets controlled by men but she doesnt see that barbie land is a place which has a woman dictatorship I was prepared for an fun time with laughs but was rather left devastated by this film because it tries to criticize how we treat feminism and gender equality but then it gets it wrong and finds problems where they is none It rather comes across as the message woman are good men are bad This is not the type of film that would inspire a little girl to be something special this is the type of film she doesnt even understand or care for out of this Was this in to,4.0,23 July 2023,0.9421

A serious take very cherry rain So my niece sister and I male watch the movie Niece like it majority of the time for the colors and Barbie of course My sister and I We loathed it My sister disliked it she missed that this was a PG and being a mother hated the fact that she seen multiple kids under some as young as seeing this as they had multiple adult jokes and said parts of the body that kids shouldnt know yet until they are about teenagers So warning for any parent it is PG She and I also dislike the fact that whole storyline was about Barbie sad that she is flatfoot and has which everyone made fun of her and feel bad she was upset that girls whom are becoming of age shouldnt be showing that beauty has strong emphasis on everything It was bland if you actually watch the movies and ignore political or social problems we have the story is so weak Only actual part is when Ken actually tried to change a bit to stand out other then that it was basically everyone say i am ugly and I need to figure out I am not to make me feel better by showing everyone I am not ugly Ending and this is hot take in both my and my mind thought they were trying to say that womens great s gift or happiness is to take care of their daughter or just raise kids so we walk out of the movie hating it and thinking that they straight up made fun of both males and females males being show as idiotic meat heads and woman as I need to be accepted as beautiful and have kids to take care of Their are way better movies that show empowerment if that what you seek This just fails in everything well mostly everything music was o km and cast was great but overall just had themes they missed the mark on hard and story was just awful Not going to lie it place on same tier as the E moji Movie cash grab movie gear to kids because of flashing color and buy my product s out of this Was this in to,2.0,23 July 2023,-0.7556

Not for those expecting a fun slice of nostalgia so neil I saw this movie expecting a bit of fun with perhaps some moral messages and a few jokes thrown in for the grown ups Perhaps pitched slightly older than the films What I got was a movie that had me laughing in some spots while other spots had me thinking what on earth am I watching I know Barbie better than you re average middle age guy since Ive been buying special edition Barbie dolls for years for my now adult daughter who collects them The movie did a great job of showing some of the classic outfits and play sets that would have been recognised by the fans so the nostalgia fuel was definitely there Cameos from unexpected stars were also a treat There were some legitimately hilarious moments Such as the quip about N Sync which gave me a smile given Ryan Gosling and Just in shared history they both starred in the Mickey Mouse club show plus the long running rumours about Gosling almost becoming a member of rival band Backstreet Boys A huge laugh in the cinema came from Narrator Helen quip about casting The casting itself was great especially Robbie and Gosling who were both superb in their respective roles Other than the moments there were also moments that were uncomfortable or downright depressing Its not uncommon to have moments like that in comedy movies or kids movies In this movie though they out weighed the lighter moments The marketing certainly didnt lead me to expect a movie that would leave me feeling depressed afterward Despite being based on one of the most popular toys of all time its definitely not a movie that was made for kids There has always been controversy around awkward relationship with feminism The movie attempted to address equality by showing a Barbie land where females dominated and males like Ken were treated unfairly Then contrasting that with the real world where men dominate and women are treated unfairly Its a legitimate message and I expected it to build up to a conclusion showing that neither should be the case and everyone should be equal They attempted that but pretty much glossed over it before rushing on to the ending which was one of the biggest Moments The speeches about patriarchy were valid but were also dragged out repeatedly over the last half of the film in such a heavy handed manner that many would have tuned out from that message Meanwhile any attempt at promoting equality was undermined by every single man I remember in the film being portrayed as adorably failing at being macho or completely stupid In most cases both Of course the were but the real world women were portrayed as being regular intelligent women Not buffoons like all the men were On balance I can now understand all the comparisons between this movie an Oppenheimer The difference is that your average viewer would watch Oppenheimer expecting a lot of it to feel oppressive and depressing out of this Was this in to,5.0,23 July 2023,0.9789

Cute but limiting in scopeS CM Maybe I will be perceived as one of those insecure middle aged men who is terrified of women as labeled by another poster on here but I assure you Im not First of all Im gay so Im just here to provide a more unbiased and alternative look at the reality of what the world is nowadays when it comes to what I see between men and women Just because Im gay doesnt mean I dont have s lot of straight friends and Ive stood on the sidelines watching their lives play out quite often And as Ive offered my observations Ive had many a Barbie say Yeah I never thought of that when explaining how men think and see things Because remember as we move forward in this discussion for every Barbie out there there is a Ken too And it would indeed be interesting to see the movie Ken come out next And have it written by a man And not a man who is just trying be progressive and accepted by women But a man who truly will give side of the story too So lets begin with the patriarchal thing A deep and rather complex discussion to be sure Is there still a patriarchal mentality going on in this world Of course And there will continue to be for some time to come The world doesnt just do a because some movie called Barbie comes out and relegates men to some sort of inconsequential joke Nor did it immediately do a just because women were becoming more vocal about their rights some years ago even more when you consider the right to Just because were living in a time when its more acceptable and cool for women to take jabs at men doesnt mean change will be enacted overnight Especially in light of the fact that there are still women out there who arent terrified to use that word of men and are perfectly fine letting them take the lead in a relationship protect them when necessary and do the things that men have done in relationships since the beginning of time Remember patriarchal societies have been around since the beginning of time and you cant blame men for doing what they ALSO have seen as being expected of them Many of these expectations coming from women themselves Whether they ll admit to it or not For those who dont subscribe to the latter though and want to become independent and change that patriarchal trajectory there are indeed alternatives And I say go for it Were living in an age when women dont need men They can be pretty much anything they want to be nowadays Are there still ceilings to be shattered Yes But life really isnt that bad And what about the Barbie body image thing For decades we ve heard women complain about that impossible image that Barbie dolls have set for women But the reality is that most men dont expect that in a woman Not nearly as much as women might pretend or believe they do That s more of a socialized media construct that comes as a result of what the Barbie doll and more generally Hollywood and print media have set up In the day to day world though that s not how it is when it comes to what men expect in women Sure men talk about good looking women They ogle women Sometimes make a catcall or two But women talk about good looking men too And when a good looking man walks in the room there is no denying what the women in the room think of him Hell I saw Aladdin on Broadway and when he came out without his shirt on muscles bulging the women in the audience went nuts And in the play Take Me Out during the shower scene with a bunch of hot young men naked in the shower scene the women in the audience were nt exactly suppressing their murmuring s and responses So come on And to expand upon that I worked at a major amusement park in Anaheim for almost ten years when I was younger I was witness to thousands of couples And I can tell you that I actually saw more couples where the man was better looking than the woman than I did where the woman was better looking than the man So no men dont expect perfection Actually from the observations Ive made of women it would suggest that they do place a lot of importance on looks and physique when it comes to a man too They can pretend that they dont and that its the men who have these impossible expectations of women but it doesnt change the facts In the movie we see perspective on things So this is how Ken sees it in the real world too women want a man who is good looking has a great body has a full head of hair And oh yeah if he has a lot of money even better And add to that you have women who have special interests such as a man in uniform Or a younger man I have female friends who will only date a guy in uniform Etc So do women really want to play that expectations card I wouldnt suggest it Because they are just as guilty as men And any body self image thing that women have is more Hollywood and yes Barbie driven than what is the reality anyway Because men are way more accepting than women claim them to be Or I should say straight men are Gay men not so much I will even add that men are so accepting of women that ageism isnt even the issue that women play it up to be Women complain about men who only want a younger hotter woman and that women age out and are not treated with the same respect To that I say bull Lets say my year old female friend and I go out for dinner and our waiter is some hot younger man If my friend has a thing for younger men and hits on him depending on the moment in time that friend of mine might very well have a date for the night I can tell you that as a gay male that would not happen with that younger man if he was gay If he played on my team and I made a play for him there would only be a chance I would have a chance at him Because if you want to know what picky is ask a gay man Younger gay men wont hardly give the time of day to an older man So straight women benefit from this as well There is no such thing as becoming too old There are plenty of younger men who are willing and Ill bet where Id have a with the dude if he played on my team shed have an chance with him if he was straight Older gay men will not see the same willingness in younger gay men that straight women do in younger straight men And even if the younger guy wasnt interested in an older woman he would treat her with respect The younger gay man will very likely put the older man down But I digress Even though proven the point that women have nothing to complain about Trust me In closing are there Ken dolls who only want Barbie Sure But that s not the majority Do men appreciate a good looking woman with a nice body Yes But women appreciate the same in men too so time to move on from that discussion Both men AND women have expectations of the opposite sex As to the patriarchal thing Definitely a deeper and more complex subject But still things have changed a lot for women I know that patriarchal societies have been around for a long time They have been the norm so to speak And again a lot of women are actually still okay with that They dont mind the man taking the lead in the r relationship protecting them etc But for those who dont subscribe to that women can now be the VP of the USA or the prime minister or president of whole countries We almost had a female president here in the States Women can be and even directors of movies Some of the wealthiest people on this earth are women All kinds of opportunities Even the opportunity to get your degree get a nice job and find a husband who has a lot of money is totally hot wears a uniform is younger or whatever If the latter are your things too Women have nothing to complain about Looks age none of it matters as much as you think it does For women the Barbie syndrome may exist but reality would suggest otherwise Now boo hoo for me all of that really DOES matter when you re gay Or COL cry out loud

Really disappointing rachael parker I had high expectations based off the trailer and had purchased quite a lot of merchandise in the lead up to the films release however for me that s as good as it got brilliant marketing The first minutes were funny and entertaining but that swiftly turns sour and boring leading on to an hour and a half of speeches and overly serious moments that just were nt that touching I can see what they were trying to do with girl power but I it a little toxic and very much like they were trying to put ken back in his place which I get is probably a metaphor for how modern day women are still treated however if you re trying to show feminism to a young audience it really needs to show actual feminism and not just toxic girl power I would have loved for the ending to have involved an equal balance between the kens and the to show what a real dream world looks like The Speeches felt very overdone and they suffocated the whole film At least a quarter of the people in the cinema left half way through out of this Was this in to,3.0,23 July 2023,0.9617

As heavy handed as a movie can be jack g demos s Barbie was a huge surprise in both a positive and negative way On the upside I was not expecting as many solid comedy moments and stellar performances by Gosling and Robbie I was expecting the PG rating to be a bit more for show but it is used to good comedic effect on a number of occasions The biggest surprise was how effective the marketing team behind this film was They were not only able to elevate initial hype by tying themselves to a Nolan film but they were also able to completely disguise what the film was about Trailers would lead you to believe this will be a fun loving comedy with some character moments some heart and a lot of nostalgia Instead central theme and main plot revolve around the least nuanced take on feminism I have seen to date I would not be surprised if this script was made by having a year old girl describe the basics of patria ch ry to an A I specify that it should make an over exaggerated mean spirited narrative from it and then have some of the most unintelligent writers in hollywood tack on a monologue for the human character at the end That final monologue by the mother is one of the most insufferable things I have experienced in a movie theater out of this Was this in to,3.0,27 July 2023,0.9773
One word to sum up this movie Easy Luk rash I was really looking forward to watching this movie Great cast great global hype and the feeling that it wants to go further than just a girly Barbie movie As a matter of fact I was quite disappointed While the message that is carried in this film is really important I think that it was just to easy It only talked about things we already knew and not in a sub tile or in a new way I think it could have been so much more interesting and impact ful The scenario is also easy you already know how it is going to end in the first minutes No surprises Nevertheless I must mention the great cast costumes sets and music But in the end its just a colorful feel good movie that is empty inside Mid out of this Was this in to,5.0,25 July 2023,0.9174

So much potential jon ketchum I wanted to see this movie since the set pictures got leaked Once they released the trailer and the clips it was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me It started off great It was hilarious Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were amazing Then the actual comedy stopped Jokes fell flat The Barbie world they set up then just ignored the toy universe they spent minutes setting up to put forth terrible gags and a preachy message that made no sense For instance Barbie could only bend certain ways in the beginning then she can bend her body like a normal human then she cant again for one joke then she can again It was awful Normally Will Ferrell is at least a little bit humorous Even he was dry The best part was a fake commercial halfway through it Ive wanted to get up and walk out so bad I felt like it was also geared towards everyone in the beginning and then adults in the last minutes It became too dramatic and preachy The Lego movie managed to be geared toward the family and still gave a good message in the last few minutes That should have been the route this took out of this Was this in to,5.0,29 July 2023,0.8868

Hilarious with not very well thought out feminist philosophy ma bus rd Ill preface by saying the movie is hilarious has a ton of iconic moments and is definitely worth the watch But this is a big BUT as a woman I think it fell flat in its feminist ideas It basically as usual defined womanhood by motherhood which is a critical pitfall in my opinion especially with a prominent cast member being a trans woman making it a pristine opportunity to at least add a single line about women stepping away from the mothers role and how it doesnt define our femininity or us as women The movie also failed in showing the negative effects of patriarchy on men themselves And while its plot contained a revolution it ended with a return to status quo as usual for Hollywood cant change eh It had a very good premise to show the negatives of both matriarchy and patriarchy and choose to present what true equality might look like but chose not to It made the entire message fall flat And since this philosophy played a big role in the plot itself I feel like it was very disappointing out of this Was this in to,5.0,22 July 2023,0.8423
